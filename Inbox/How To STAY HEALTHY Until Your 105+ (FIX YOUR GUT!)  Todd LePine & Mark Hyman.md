## #intermitent-fasting
>"Intermittent fasting can do amazing things for the body. It involves periods of time where you eat and periods of time where you fast. There are multiple ways to practice intermittent fasting, such as fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window. It can also involve water or juice fasting on the weekends. Intermittent fasting has been shown to have positive effects on the body, including supporting mitochondrial health, promoting detoxification, and aiding in weight management."

## #antibiotics

>"Most of us have taken antibiotics at some point in our lives, whether to treat an infection or prevent one after surgery. While antibiotics can be life-saving, they can also have unintended consequences for our gut health. Antibiotics work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, but they don't discriminate between harmful bacteria and the beneficial ones in our gut. This indiscriminate action can disrupt the delicate balance of our gut microbiota, leading to a condition called dysbiosis. Dysbiosis is characterized by a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria. It has been linked to various health problems, including digestive disorders, immune dysregulation, and even mental health issues."

## Transcript Summary:

- Dr. Mark Hyman and Dr. Todd LePine discuss the importance of maintaining a healthy gut for overall well-being.
- They highlight that a significant portion of the immune system is located in the gut. Disrupting the gut ecosystem can lead to immune system dysfunction.
- Dr. Todd LePine is recognized as an expert in functional medicine and has extensive experience in the field. He has taught at various conferences and worked with thousands of patients.
- The conversation delves into topics such as biotech detoxification, systemic inflammation, GI health, neurobiology of mood, and cognitive disorders.
- Dr. LePine explains that incorporating prebiotic foods like pomegranate, maca, fiber, and cranberries into the diet can promote a healthy gut by nourishing beneficial organisms.
- Functional medicine is presented as a new approach to disease, focusing on individualized treatment based on identifying root causes rather than relying solely on labels or symptoms.
- They discuss the interconnection between the gut microbiome, systemic inflammation, and diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver, autism, and Parkinson's.
- Detoxification, mitochondrial health, intermittent fasting, and personalized medicine are mentioned as strategies to improve overall health and address chronic conditions.
- The conversation highlights the role of toxins, including pharmaceuticals, in disrupting health, and the importance of water systems in preventing their spread.
- They mention the benefits of intravenous therapies like vitamin C and IV NAD+ for certain patients.
- Dr. LePine shares a case study of a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's who experienced positive outcomes through personalized treatment.
- The approach at their wellness center is described as individualized rather than protocol-based, focusing on finding unique pathways to restore health and well-being.

(00:00) most of your immune system is in your gut yeah so when you disrupt that that ecosystem that rainforests inside of you you are disrupting the the immune system [Music] welcome to the doctors pharmacy I'm dr. Mark Hyman and that's pharmacy LAN ffar ma CY a place for conversations that matter and if you've struggled with any chronic illness this is the conversation need to listen to because it's with one of the leading experts in the world on how to deal with chronic disease which is my colleague here at the ultra wellness
(00:30) center dr. Todd Lupino Todd and I go way back in fact Todd knew about functional medicine before I even heard about it way back at Canyon Ranch in the 1990s that's right 1990s we are old but we look young and he was way ahead of the curve and he still is he's still really one of the most brilliant minds in functional medicine he teaches everywhere he's certified by the Institute for functional medicine in functional medicine obviously he worked with me Canyon Ranch for ten years and now he's worked here for a decade at the
(01:04) ultra wellness center and collectively we have literally probably five decades worth of experience in functional medicine between the two of us seeing so many thousands of patients who struggled for so long with so many issues when they finally get here they find there's a new way of thinking about disease and it gives them an opportunity to actually get healthy again and we're just so grateful to have you here at the ultra honest center and you'll do the work we do you really helped work on some of the
(01:31) most leading-edge concepts in medicine around biotech detoxification and systemic inflammation GI health a neurobiology of mood and cognitive sorters he's given lectures all around the world at age management conferences at American College for the Advancement of medicine he's taught at the University of Miami integrated medicine conference at crow Paulo and he's on the side of advisory board of designs for health and consults with diagnostic solutions lab and he's very active he skis the kayaks he hikes he camps he
(02:01) golf's he loves the Berkshires and yeah he's just been extraordinary addition to our Center so welcome dr. Todd Lapine thank you Mar thank you are those real eyes okay so you start off your career working as a resident at a VA hospital yes and that's best learning experience ever yeah pretty much you see everything and you get to do everything exactly you've been there hey you know I have well I have and I you had this patient who has quite a problem that gives a lot of insight into functional medicine
(02:36) which is called to panic encephalopathy which in English means that when your liver fails you can't detoxify and all your normal metabolic toxins makes you delirious and can even put you in a coma and gives you all these brain symptoms so what happened when you treated him with the typical treatment and tell us what that is because it's kind of an unusual treatment for a brain problem right exactly exactly so yeah so this story is I was a resident and I was you know wet-behind-the-ears and I had a patient at the VA and a lot of patients
(03:10) the VA there someone had alcohol tobacco abuse and he had deliver failure and he came in in a coma with the pedicles but by the way just to the side there it used to be the most common source of liver failure was alcohol yeah now it's sugar yeah right right she's a big reason for liver transplants right yeah so anyway so he comes in a completely in a coma I mean he could stick a pin in and he would move and so we worked him up and I had to learn about I've had a Kinsella the-- cuz i don't really know what it
(03:43) was and so we treated him and you know i found out that it was related to his liver not being able to detoxify and he had also had a high-protein meal intake and the protein gets digested by the gut bacteria and all the blood from the liver goes out all the blood from the gut has to get filtered through the liver before it goes into the systemic circulation so what we did with him is we basically treated him with a nothing by mouth we gave him antibiotics I believe was neomycin you stopped feeding the back yeah we just using the time we just
(04:16) exactly so we just weekly basically we cleaned out the food for the bad bacteria in the gut we sort of give his gut arrest gave him antibiotics and neomycin intravenously also gave him laxatives specifically lactulose at the time I don't know if you yellow signore mice and orally though don't you give the neomycin orally we actually week I'm trying you might or it might have been early and might it might be action it might have been early right it could very well have been early so we gave him lactulose and we also
(04:44) actually believed we're not gave him probiotics and within 24 hours this guy was in a complete coma completely woke up just like you know the proverbial Lazarus and it was like it was amazing to me so I've been looking at it and I'm saying gonna wake you up exactly how is that that'll wake you up and I said you know this guy came you know woke up from the dead and I was like it actually left an indelible impression on my experience as a physician saying there is a huge connection between the gut in the brain
(05:08) and then that has led me on the quest that have gone on for all these years and seeing the connection how our internal ecosystem the microbiome and the food that we eat and the food that that we feed the bugs affects our health in good ways or bad ways yeah so it's so true and I remember learning about the disease and I was like how come doctors don't connect the dots with the gut and everything else that goes wrong on the body right because the treatment for this coma that's caused by liver failure
(05:38) is essentially giving antibiotics that aren't absorbed you kill all the bugs in the gut that are producing these toxins that make them crazy or make them in a coma hmm so and then you give them a lot of laxatives to make them poop everything out yep and that's just kind of a miracle happens right it was a Marilyn exactly yeah is that waking from the dead exactly and and and then led you to kind of understand the interconnectedness of everything right and then you know when we see patients all the time a lot of patients come in
(06:06) to is to say doc I've got brain fog that is low-grade you know by this yeah you say yeah your zombie yeah that called zombie just what you're living day you're walking around but you're not really there your brain is of being affected by some of these chemicals and there's a lot of different chemicals that are produced by gut bacteria some of them are Putra seen and cadaverine know you know what cadaverine is you know you don't want a lot of cadaverine less rekha davor right right Oh sound like terrible
(06:33) things Putra seen and cadaverine those are the toxins that get released from bad digestion right yeah and that well even one that one of the compounds is that we measure now in the office here is TMAO trimethylamine oxides is the same type of back bacterial byproduct of metabolism of certain food products so certain bacteria will eat certain foods and produce these compounds which have psychoactive properties or anti-inflammatory properties because TMAO is one of the risk factors for heart disease so one of the central
(07:03) ideas of functional medicine is you start with a gut yeah it's almost what you start with with anybody who's got anything which is kind of a weird thing because like I can just read everything with one thing but it actually is a foundation of our health and when our microbiome is out of balance it leads to a whole host of problems I'm absolutely and and the big thing that's that you know I don't treat children with autism but the biggest thing that I think that is affecting this country is the microbiome that
(07:30) we're not inheriting from our mothers because what happens so often now is that when mothers go into the hospital they're getting antibiotics beforehand half of them 40% 50% are getting c-sections so we are destroying we don't breastfeed don't breastfeed exactly never give me any kids antibiotics it give you antibiotics and vaccinations on day one you know for appetite is B and this this microbiome that we have literally inherited from generation to generation because it's something that's
(07:59) really passed down from the mothers to the daughters to the granddaughters is being lost and the loss specifically of Bifidobacterium infantis it's actually been in I think was in the New York Times that is talking about this loss of this what one of many beneficial bacteria that we are losing in as part of the human species and it's affecting our whole health so let's like back up a little bit and talk about this whole thing of the microbiome because we started with functional medicine there wasn't the word microbiome but we still
(08:27) focused on normalizing the gut function we talked about the for our program which is a restoration program for the gut and how that can help so many different diseases but what is the microbiome why is it important what does it do I mean we thought it was just poop and now it's like basically the holy grail for figuring everything out yeah so it's it's gold it's gold and actually you know in brown gold is brown color so so so down in Boston you know so the microbiome is the sum total of all the
(08:57) organisms that we have and care around inside of us and that also can include viruses it can also include fun and it's not necessarily we call it good and bad but it depends really upon the situation because like for example all of us carry around C difficile bacteria mmm C difficile bacteria when you take an antibiotic it'll wipe out some of the good bacteria and then the bad guys if you will they'll sort of start to over grow and then they can produce toxins so with helping me and I always died from
(09:24) it exactly it's very exactly and the treatment of choice for that is you you know if you have a really bad case the treatment choice is a stool transplant which is like an organ transplant and the interesting thing is that one of the companies that does this is open biome in Boston which I think you're aware of and they use freeze-dried stool and that is one of the cures literally for a really messed up gut microbiome because if you don't get poop pills now poop pills yep crap crap CIL's crap right and
(10:05) and so so and and what it is is and I always make analogies because that's how patients understand things it's sort of like you know the ecosystem of the microbiome inside the body is like a rainforest and at some point some people's ecosystems are so disturbed and so messed up this like napalm has hit your rainforest so it's like a corn mono crop yeah and so you what you need to do is you need to repopulate repopulate the microbiome and you can't do that just with probiotics so we use probiotics we
(10:39) use prebiotics and use those together we call them syn biotics and those are often times very helpful but for the really sick people who have things like refractory c-diff stool transplant is the number one treatment yeah interesting so you've got this whole ecosystem bacteria it's been disturbed by all these reasons you talked about c-sections antibiotic use lack of breastfeeding and so on and our diet also plays a huge role in the growth of good or bad bacteria so you can feed it certain things that it makes it worse
(11:13) and other things that it makes it better so talk about that yeah so so I always tell pay that when you're eating food you want to be choosing your food not just for you what you like your your you know the things that are pleasurable for you but you also want to be feeding the good bacteria we talked earlier about the Ackermann SIA missin Ophelia that's a specific bacteria that is in the body and that you want to have on high levels and when we do to the testing we can actually determine do you have high
(11:39) levels of it or do you have low levels or do you have no levels are very low levels and there are certain foods which you can incorporate into your diet things like pomegranate in Makkah and a case of Ocasio fiber cranberries and things like that these are foods which are basically pre pre pre biotics and when you incorporate them into your diet you it's like putting Miracle Grow on that garden they start to flourish they start to take over and they help balance out the whole ecosystem yeah I think it's one of the biggest advances
(12:08) in our thinking about God we didn't get probiotics and that'll fix it but you know you're giving like 50 billion is a lot right but you have it's 100 trillion bacteria so it's like a drop in the ocean exactly and one of the big insights I had was actually from an experience I had last year where I developed colitis it's a long story but I had been sick from mold and I told that story and I had a recurrence of my gut because I had to see diff and that was kind of really messed me up and I checked my stool and
(12:38) had really low levels of this akram an SIA which has been linked to autoimmune disease billing to poor response to immunotherapy for cancer it's been linked to card even if I was not good so I started to research it and created this cocktail of cranberry pomegranate green tea acacia fiber some probiotics other prebiotics and I took it and it literally within three weeks I went from full-blown colitis to completely normal perfect yeah and it was sort of a wake-up call for me which was you can't just get probiotics
(13:13) you've got to feed the whole inner garden and I wouldn't like siz certain foods and it likes all the polyphenols yes in the poly phenyl holler full dark rainbow color of chemicals that are in plant foods yeah a certain plant foods have more than like the berries and so forth absolutely yeah the polyphenols are our goal and that to me I think that's actually probably one of the things that platino roll with the French paradox is the polyphenols that are found in red wine yeah I think that's you know definitely
(13:37) what you're doing is you're actually feeding the you know patients love me because the two things that I always prescribe to my patients is chocolate and red wine right and they're there and they're hi there and say people like wine drink but I wouldn't give it as an extra thing no right right what I'm just I'm just I'm just razzing but with the but the polyphenols are the the miracle food prebiotics for the gut absolutely so tell us a story about a patient who had a screwed up microbiome and what you
(14:03) did and how they got better I've had I mean multiple patients I mean like it's for example I just had a patient this followed up today eighteen year old with fatty liver disease and pre-diabetes a picture and lo and behold I did the testing for him and his achromatic missus NFL II was almost undetectable yeah and no fatty liver typically you said we used to see this in patients who were drinking alcohol what we're now finding out is that fatty liver is the thing that is being driven by disruption of the gut
(14:36) microbiome so what's happening is when you destroy the mucus the protective mucus lining of the gut some of those bad bacteria get into the into the into the body get into the circulation they go into the liver and causes systemic inflammation which in turn causes fatty liver and it was just I don't of you saw the recent paper about this about what is termed non-alcoholic fatty livers actually from alcohol produced by gut bacteria yeah so some bacterial actually produce alcohol which in turn poisons
(15:05) the liver mints right ferments that's like you know you get this bloating food baby that's actually your bacteria fermenting the food you're eating and certain foods are more fermentable like starches and sugars exactly yeah we we actually have seen cases of patients who literally had elevated blood alcohol level auto-brewery syndrome from the bacteria in their gut yeah and they literally got pulled over and found you know the head like for drunk driving exactly it actually did the auto-brewery syndrome is and I've had a couple of
(15:37) patients with that and they typically that's usually been this attributed to yeast overgrowth but there also are cases specifically with back that can also produce alcohol I mean you're basically it's like I said brewery and your button yeah your body yeah you don't need a Budweiser no this Bud's for you so the so what happened when you have this patient and yeah so so I mean you basically you work on doing dietary and you get better when you fix this or you just say well this was just I just I was just up here
(16:08) because I just had this patient this morning and I'd it was a very interesting case because the thing that really stood out is that his protective necromancy philia was quite low he was also a vegan which you know we could discuss you know what is the best diet I don't believe that veganism is actually the best thing I think we're omnivores and you know I come from a family of dentists so I always talk to my patients you see that yeah thing right there that's like that's a canine tooth and a
(16:33) canine tooth is designed to chew meat into to fish and we have specific enzymes in the body which are pancreatic elastase and proteases which are designed to digest protein yeah so we are you know like Michael Pollan said it best eat plants eat food real food mostly plants not too much right so a plant-based diet with healthy amounts of fish and lean meat on occasion is really probably the best type of diet and I think some of my most difficult patients are the ones who are sort of strict vegans for whatever reason ethical or
(17:08) spiritual or whatever religious can oftentimes get into really difficult situations because it's like a cat chasing their tail they don't have this specific nutrients to patch up and and heal the body wasn't all that plant stuff helped the micro bio it does absolutely it's gonna help the microbiome but he was he was whoa he had almost no Omega threes it was really nutritionally deficient I see unless people are supplementing they get super nutrition well is that that you can have a person like that it was just in it was
(17:34) just in the news recently it was a 22 year old I think was over in England who was living on potato chips white bread and french fries and when goes on and fries went blind there's no vitamin A yeah went blind so you can be walking and talking but and you know you can be severely malnourished yeah because there's a you know there's about 40 nutrients that your body needs on a regular basis and I to also make the analogy to my patients is like your body is like a house that's being built and broken down 24/7 you
(18:07) need all those building materials to make that house you know any carpeting you need would you need glass you need all these materials and if those materials aren't there then the structure may still be standing but if you don't have glass the wind comes in the rain comes in the snow comes in and then you're gonna have problems with your with your problem traditional medicine is they don't look for those building blocks they don't test for them and that's what's different here at the
(18:29) Ultra Wellness Center we actually look for these things we find I mean when was the last time a doctor looked for a cure man see and someone with fatty liver probably never Yeah right other than us here or some function might check their omega-3s or check their vitamin D exactly yeah right and so those kinds of Diagnostics are available and helped us really think differently about treating disease I mean most doctors understand hepatic encephalopathy but most doctors were treating fatty liver don't actually
(18:56) think about what's going on and I got microbiome or how to treat it they don't even know how to fix it well you know I thing that one of my pet peeves mark and I'm sure you've heard this too is that patients will go see the expert and Wrekin ologist for their diabetes in the expert gastroenterologist and they tell the patients to eat anything they want mmm that is absolutely mean food has something to do with our health it does oh my god what a radical idea my favorite my favorite was once I was at
(19:23) Canyon Ranch I was playing basketball at lunch because he had these basketball pickup games and there was one of this people there was playing and he was a gastroenterologist and I said to him you know you ever thought of like how you know food my impact was happening in the gut because you're putting literally pounds of this stuff through that tube every day you think I might have something to do with why people have digestive symptoms he's like gee you know I never thought of that that seems so interesting yeah
(19:49) that makes a lot of sense and I'm like holy crap all right you know but yeah I mean your microbiome is dependent on what you feed it how you grow your inner garden depends on what you're eating yeah and you can create a nasty garden with weeds and toxins and bad stuff and poisonous plants oh you can create a really flourishing rich garden it actually takes care of you yeah absolute and also the other asset thing that a lot of even physicians are not even aware of is that most of your immune system is in your gut yeah so when you
(20:18) disrupt that that ecosystem that rainforests inside of you you are disrupting the the immune system and we're talking about fecal transplants there's a recent study that showed that children with autism who got stool transplants had a marked improvement up to two years out from just replacing the gut microbiome yeah I mean that's pretty powerful so there is no pharmacologic autism is like an encephalopathy it's a metabolic it's to some degree that's like an simple opportunity I mean that's
(20:47) that's that's to me that's that's sort of the canary in the coal mine in our environment today you know that we have one in 68 kids having autism now depending on where you are living in America and around the world is a big big issue and what we're finding out is there's more and more connection to the the microbiome yeah I mean so 60% of our immune system is in the gut yep essentially there's a sewer that's on the other side of the lining of your gut which is only one cell thick
(21:18) and on the other side is your immune system and there's a breakdown which can come from having c-sections antibiotics acid blocking drugs stress poor diet yep all that stuff damages the gut creates this leaky got gluten dairy all those things then you get this inflammation so we treat a lot of people autoimmune disease here at the ultra wana Center and and often the place we start is the gut yeah so tell us like how how that works and and and about some patients you might have had with autoimmune disease and how working on their gut
(21:51) helped them yeah so I mean I had a one patient in particular who I saw who came in was great stories she came in and she was having MS as her diagnosis she also had autoimmune disease autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis and she also had infertility and I did a complete workup on her she had dysbiosis had bacteria and yeast overgrowth also had sensitivity to gluten and had also some not a heavy not a big level but at some level of mercury in the body so I worked on diet worked on you know both prebiotics and
(22:29) probiotics to clean up the gut got her completely off of gluten and lo and behold guess what her multiple sclerosis went away amazing disappeared all right not to say that and you've all heard metals out - yeah not to say that all cases of multiple sclerosis are due to that but there are many pathways to multiples closest just that there are many pathways to alzheimers disease or any disease there any disease exactly because the body hit will manifest it in in in only certain inflammatory pathways but and then so ultimately she got off
(23:01) of her medications her MS to this day is in complete remission she has no symptoms on no meds and as a side effects she got pregnant wow that's a good side effect yeah and she was happy so that's that's an amazing story and I think you know for people are listening functional medicine is a new way of thinking about disease it's not based on the label ms it's based on the costs and you can have one disease that has many causes like MS which can be caused by heavy metals by Lyme disease by step
(23:28) steam bar by the gut microbiome by gluten you know I like b12 deficiency right you can have so many things that are driving this same syndrome right and the personalization of Medicine is what functional medicine is all about and that's really what's different here about how we practice medicine at the Ultra Wellness Center because we're looking at each person is an individual or creating a personalized medicine and personalized health which is a radically new way of thinking and we just lump everybody with the same
(23:55) symptoms into the same categories but it doesn't tell you anything about the cause and I always say just because you know the name of your disease doesn't mean you know what's wrong with you right and that's what we do to very detailed histories here through very advanced diagnostic testing go look some of these things absolutely and the I think the the enjoyable thing I'm sure that you experience yourself is that every patient is unique yeah you know I've never treated two patients the same
(24:20) way from a functional approach no a completely different even in the same family it's a everyone is and that's actually the fun part about it is the I call it you know the person comes in with their own genetic uniqueness their own you know personality make up their own story all of these you know things that you can paint the picture of you know where were they when they got sick where are they now and what are the things that you know that we can remove you know like the for our what was it like being doctor house right like
(24:52) medical detective exactly and and you know I think you know one of the most important things that that I always tell people who are training and medicine is to listen to the patient yeah they'll tell you what's wrong absolutely when and what exactly and and and sometimes I just have to sort of bite my my mouth cause you want to always interrupt agents you know what about this or what about that I just sort of let patients talk more and I just sort of listen and then I'll ask the questions later and when you really do
(25:16) that and let the patients tell their story in their own way in their own terms and get that out you really find out all the little details and you can play house and play a detective sort of you know piece the piece of the puzzle together yeah you know we in regular medicine we are trained to create an exclusive history in other words someone comes in with a symptom let's say they have heartburn or reflux or chest pain we don't want to know anything else about them except about that all right we want all the details about that we
(25:44) don't know if they have a rash or their nail fingernails cracked do they have eczema there's their butt itch like don't talk to me about any of that because that's not relevant and in functional medicine all of its relevant because it's a clue that could give you a clue to what's actually happening for that patient and that's what's so beautiful about this process you know I think I used to work in the emergency room I think you did too it's boring it's boring because
(26:09) someone comes in he was like okay it's the heart attack treatment it's the asthma treatment it's a kidney stone protocol it's like it's like you just look at the nurse you've got heart attack okay they don't they know what the orders are they know what you usually write it down and it's like it's like rote and boring it's it's it's a it's a formula like a recipe right in functional medicine there is no recipe there's actually having a Fink every time you see a patient right right and
(26:31) and you know and you know being trained in traditional medicine and also in a functional medicine approach there's definitely you know if you're having a heart attack you know I want to from ballooning absolutely I want no need no me surgery right and watch I want you to follow the protocol that has been shown to work but for chronic conditions you know acute care medicine which is basically the scalpel or the trip shinpad are probably some of the more toxic things that you can have a lot of what I see in in in my patients
(26:58) here is iatrogenic imperfecta all right which babies like that doctors like that basically me the doctor did it right so the patient comes in and they're on a whole laundry list of medications and these are interacting you know they're on proton pump inhibitors are causing the acid blockers they're causing calcium deficiency mineral deficiency b12 deficiency so there's you know there's these these drugs have their their risk benefit and the the less drugs you use in medicine the better off
(27:28) the patient is yeah it's hard because that's what we know how to do it's what we're trained to do yeah like we don't have people with food as medicine we don't know how to restore a gut from a messed up gut to a healthy gut and that's really what we do in functional medicine yeah and I also another important thing that it's important for physicians out there who are new to functional medicine also for patients is to realize these things don't happen overnight it can take time but usually
(27:51) sometimes you can see a difference in in you know days to weeks sometimes it takes months and sometimes it takes years it depends depends on what's going on so true I mean I said eyes it's like it's almost miraculous and you go like it's hard to believe I remember when I first started practicing I was like oh okay do these things take this eat this and then they'd call back few weeks later or you know a month later I'm like how you doing well I'm all better I'm like what better from that cuz I'm so it
(28:15) was such a contradiction to everything I learned but then I started to trust it and I started to expect it and I just remember this one patient she had psoriatic arthritis which is a horrible condition where you're you've got psoriasis but your joints are being deformed and destroyed you're in pain all the time but she had a bunch of other stuff which quote was unrelated she had depression she had insomnia she was overweight she had terrible reflux and heartburn and she was having bloating and SIBO and irritable bowel
(28:42) and I'm like okay well let's see she's inflamed everything she's got is inflamed the wait is inflamed depressions and inflammation in the brain her gut symptoms are about inflammation the gut you know everything is related to inflammation so what why don't we sort of just start simple and clear out things that are causing potential inflammation so we got rid of gluten and dairy on your dye and sugar and starch and all processed food we got our got cleaned up I gave her an antibiotic and any fungal and a little gut Program
(29:09) a couple of nutrients to help her fight some some inflammation there she was good suffering from and six weeks later she came back her psoriasis was gone or arthritis was gone her reflux and arrow bow was gone or depression was gone she lost 20 pounds I'm like and she got off her medications even the one that was costing 50 grand a year to suppress your immune system from the psoriasis Wow and it seems like a you know seems like a miracle but it really isn't when you follow this methodology and that's what
(29:36) we've been doing here for decades practicing functional medicine and up in the Berkshires and yeah it's pretty amazing well it's really interesting because most of the patients who have psoriasis are gonna see dermatologists and most dermatologists do not have a clue about the gut microbiome nor they test you're thinking about it right and then you if then if they get psoriasis and they developed psoriatic arthritis which is our thright us in addition to the skin condition because I always tell
(29:58) patients is the skin is contiguous with the gut so if I draw a line on the skin and I keep drawing a line and go down my tongue and I go into my esophagus down on my stomach in my intestine I'm still in the same surface yeah so oftentimes and you know this mark is that's true is it thought of that yeah it's yes that's that's how I explain to patients so the skin is contiguous with a gun it's an ecto dermal tissue and when their skin issues think gun it's really a tube - it's outside your body here's
(30:26) your gut yeah it's true I mean when I'm a patient with psoriasis eczema acne rosacea treat their gut yeah and I don't put stuff all over their face or on their body exactly and suppress the inflammation I get rid of that and it's like it's like really in America miracle I mean it is I mean dermatology is not something that I'm an expert in although I was trained as a family doctor in dermatology but I feel like it's we get the most amazing results just for something as simple as fixing the gut and changing the diet
(30:58) absolutely yeah exactly yeah the bodies is interconnected complex self-healing organism I mean we're that's the big thing is I often ask patients I mean do you think you're gonna get better and and if I have a patient who thinks they're gonna get better than together we're gonna get better but if a patient doesn't think they're gonna get better then I try to get them to change their mindset cuz somebody even though somebody comes to me they they really almost believe I'm not gonna get better
(31:26) well that's what they've been taught exactly live with this exactly to manage your disease right and and I want to manage your and and and and the body's ability to self-heal is amazing as you as you know it's really amazing there's an intelligence in the body that we you know haven't you know as much as we know about the body there's a lot more that we don't know and I you know the more I practice medicine I think the more humble I become exact how little I know it sounds complex it is it's really
(31:55) really complex but but there's so much that we can do for patients that you know they've gone to you know the Mayo Clinic they've gone to Mass General they go into you know X Y & Z everywhere else and they you know as you say the resort medicine would come here for last resort I mean I literally just walked from my office to here after seeing a patient who went to the Mayo Clinic who had chronic dizziness chronic constipation fatigue insomnia all these different symptoms that they couldn't find quote
(32:23) anything wrong with him and I'm like well I know what's wrong with you you've got this this and this and this based on looking at it through the functional medicine lens yeah well and the other thing is is you know I think I think was a Sid Baker I think who made the analogy it was in or maybe was Jeff plan is that you know if you have a dime and you it's a sign you're on a dark street you lose your dime over there in the streetlights over here and you're looking under the streetlight which is where you're
(32:48) testing so most the tests thing is basically looking where the dime isn't yeah alright so the type of testing that we do here which is nutritional metabolic toxic genomic testing is is spreading out the search light to find that done absolutely that's such a key point because you know you go to the doctor and they say well we've tested everything and all your results are normal and the implication is it's all in your head but I would say I don't agree with that because you know either two things are true one the
(33:17) patient's crazy or the doctors are missing something and I'm gonna ban the doctors missing something yeah because when we start to look we find all sorts of stuff in places that nobody's looked before because they're looking under the street lamp instead of actually where the problem really is exactly yes exactly right yeah I think you know when you alluded to before was really important which is that functional medicine is about getting rid of the things that impair health and putting in the things that help the body thrive and
(33:41) then the body can take over and with this amazing intelligence can repair and heal from all sorts of things Oh totally yeah and that's what we do so what is that you know one of the complaints we see a lot is fatigue everybody's tired right and and in functional medicine we talk a lot about something called the mitochondria which you're really an expert in and it's something that is really the one of the keys I'm solving many problems and puzzles in chronic disease whether it's Parkinson's or
(34:09) Alzheimer's or diabetes or obviously fatigue issues and so forth fibromyalgia tell us about what are these mitochondria how do we look at them and in you know what do we do about it okay so for those who don't know about mitochondria it really it's it's another area of mind that is really fascinating sort of interest of mine so our mitochondria are actually ancient bacteria see poop bacteria you're in the same track absolutely right so say well one track my right and and I'll never forget I went to a lecture given by Jeff
(34:43) bland and he was talking about how antibiotics which are designed to kill bacteria yeah can oftentimes affect mitochondria because our mitochondria which are the power plants of our bodies are actually way back when were ancient bacteria that became engulfed in our cells and are now the power plants may have different DNA they've totally totally different DNA in fact the Lynn Margulis who was murdered to Carl Sagan I had the opportunity to meet her and have lunch with her yeah it was it was amazing for those you don't know she's sort of an
(35:15) icon in the world of biology yes first describe this whole phenomenon yes exactly so sheshe it was right during the 60s everyone was studying the the nuclear DNA which is the double helix DNA and she's she made an observation there's DNA in the cell in a circular form and she goes well what does that mean where'd that come from so she stand she was actually uh protist she studied small ancient bacteria and she realized that that DNA reminded her of the ancient bacteria and then she came up with a hypothesis that
(35:47) eukaryotic cells which are the cells that we have actually way back when those little bacteria came and sort of created this symbiotic relationship where you scratch my back I'll scratch your back yeah and and that's really you know how we have mitochondria and mitochondria are so important didn't this I always tell patients is that you take cyanide you will die in a matter of minutes and the reason for that is cyanide flips the switch on your mitochondria turns or mom turns them up like that yeah basically that's what
(36:18) happens when you die you have no energy anymore lights out any lights are out and yet there's varying forms of lights out with mitochondria yeah really common whether it's autism or finding now Alzheimer's Parkinson's right and the interesting thing about it is there's a thing called the bottleneck theory of mitochondria which is that you know let's say well before you go on so mitochondria for the fuel these little tiny things inside your cells there can be hundreds to thousands of them and they basically take oxygen that
(36:45) you breathe and the food that you eat and they burn them like an engine and outside and out comes energy which is what runs your body in the form of ATP so that's what has to happen every day every minute for you to run every chemical reaction your body to run everything that you're doing every day and when that process gets bummed up you get sick exactly that's very well put exactly you get bunda especially the highly metabolic issues so things like the brain things like the heart are the highly dense mitochondria and then the
(37:12) other thing which is new on the medical world is brown fat so brown is pad highly packed with mitochondria you look at under a microscope it actually looks brown and brown fat is the type of fat that we have it generates heat and in order to activate our brown fat we need to be cold and how many people nowadays ever get really cold because we always like that thermostat right at 70 degrees yeah it goes to snowing that I go in the ice bath every day yeah it's alright so that the temperature goes to 71 we turned we
(37:43) turn on the air-condition goes below we turn on the heat right we people in this thermonuclear zone and we never actually activate our brown fat and activating our brown fat by being in the cold in fact this past weekend I was at Omega Institute and I actually camped out and it's a long story but I brought my tent and my tent didn't have the poles to it so I had to sleep on the ground on my in my sleeping bag and forts in the city bag was warm sleeping bag but I got cold at night but guess what I slept great
(38:11) yeah I slept great it's true the best sleep I've had in years was when I went back country ski with my daughter last spring and we literally climb six mile six hours straight up to this jerk which was literally six feet under the snow way to dig it out and I sucked my seam back there it was freezing and I slept the best I slept ever yes you're like a semi hibernation I actually I actually bought something called the chili pad yeah which is essentially a cooling pad that you put on your mattress I can turn
(38:38) down like 63 degrees at night because my wife likes it high and I like it cold I think she I think I think she did a little podcast about that I was a comedian you can look her up it at my meal luxe on Instagram and you can watch that funny spoof on how she has to wear a winter coat to bed with which that's not quite true but yes yeah yes oh my yeah so mitochondria and then you know how do we test for money condom you know when you go to most doctors most doctors don't even remember mitochondria in their in their training nor do they ever
(39:14) a test for so we test for organic acids for it you can also urine cuz it's urine test yeah relatively easy to do and you can also do genetic testing for mitochondria there are some labs out there coredegon was one of the labs that we used to use but they're no longer around there's another one called gene savvy that does testing for mitochondria and when you get an inherited mitochondrial issue that's where you know may be seeing some serious yeah that's as much more serious but you can also have a lot of acquired
(39:42) mitochondrial issues and that the good news is is that we can heal our mitochondria when we actually go through pure so before you can do but him what messes them up what messes them up yeah what messes them up um well excessive oxidative stress will do it so infections yeah yeah so excess amounts of free radicals I've saved stress because your your your mitochondria is like a fireplace you throw logs into your fireplace which is food and you give off Sparks and you throw too much food logs in the fireplace you get too much Sparks and
(40:11) you get too much free wrap too many calories so you tell me if you add calories you me bad calories exeter and starch and too many bad calories not compensated by enough dietary antioxidants is another potential source antibiotics are huge yeah especially the flocks ins i mean that's that's a whole topic under your unto itself as being flocks to which I'm sure you've seen patients with that because they definitely are a know and a bactericidal antibiotics are definitely poisonous to mitochondria and statin medications that
(40:40) you know the ones that the muscle liking that people get is because there might a kind you're getting injured it so the the cardiology handed out like Pez candy right mark yeah it should be no issue it should be in the water right we should just you know they wanted to sell it at McDonald's yeah right everyone with your Big Mac yeah exactly yeah it's but they they are and they do cause muscle damage and and some people are more susceptible to it absolutely and and there's genetic variations in how people respond to
(41:06) statins and that's probably has to do their mitochondrial fraction right now but it's it's for sure so so toxins also like heavy metals and pesticides are poisonous too much sugar and starch and calories oxidative stress it comes from inflammation I mean that's when you have the viral flu you feel achy and tired and sore because your mitochondria getting nuked yep right nutritional deficiencies right we know that all sorts of nutrients like carnitine Co Q 10 B vitamins all play a big role in the mitochondrial function
(41:35) so and and and of phosphatidylcholine for the membranes of the mitochondria the other thing that's also really important and as you're well aware that is the the concept of doing fasting periodically and I find this actually quite fascinating because a lot of religions have fasting as part of their their religious belief system and when you actually look at that giving your gut a time period of rest and when you go through these periods of of fasting your body starts eating up your bad mitochondria that's Auto foggy
(42:06) we call that the self the body's eating itself so when garbage truck coming cleaning up all the ways from your cells it was that you renew and repair and regenerate exactly and actually get younger and and and and intermittent fasting can do amazing amazing things for the body and what is that that's like when you eat between a yeah there's there's multiple ways to do that you can eat like you know 16 hours without food eater in an eight-hour window or maybe on the weekends just have water or juice fast
(42:33) or something like that there's different ways of doing that but when you cut back on your calories dramatically and you do that for an extended period of time your body goes into what's called ketosis as you as you well know and then your body also starts to generate increased antioxidant enzyme systems and that also starts to clean up and sweep home sweep the house gets rid of all the bad so using snacking and eating all the way till bed and waking up and I'm breakfast that's the worst thing no exact well
(43:01) it's great unless you're great unless you're like a teenager and you're like here you met your metabolism it's gone wild you need to be fed all time because you're just growing all the time but you know three meals a day with snacks is probably not the best thing I mean that's an important thing because you know a lot of people have mitochondrial issues and I personally had severe medical issues because I got chronic fatigue syndrome for Mercury and my muscle enzymes went way up and I had
(43:22) severe muscle aches and fatigue and it was it was really working on my mitochondria by getting rid of the metals and fixing my gut and giving myself a lot of mitochondrial nutrients that really helped me recover from that yeah yeah and and the I mean they're actually working on some of the nutrients like the the nutrients that increase the NAD+ in the body or even intravenous nad which is another for IV therapies has been shown to be quite helpful for rain for issues absolutely Rama of the brain and oh yeah I'm
(43:55) disorders yeah yeah very very powerful enough even for people or flocks that's actually one of the treatments yeah so what you're talking about is providing a lot of the nutrients so one you have to stop doing all the bad things it caused to be a problem and two you have to provide the basic support to help them work better all right so whether it's intermittent fasting or calorie restriction for periods of time or days of fasting whether it's these nutrients like nad which you can now take orally
(44:20) cook 10 and these are the kinds of things we look at in functional medicine and until trombonist enter we can test for these things we can see what's not working and unless you look you don't know what's going on that's really the beauty of this approach because we might not see quote a disease but we might see a dysfunction and I've had patients with Parkinsons disease who know everyone now I've had ten years of Parkinson's and he's doing amazing and hasn't progressed in fact got better
(44:44) yeah I'm where he was by working on all these things yeah parkinson's is tough depends where you catch them but the big thing is is to try to arrest the progression and try to reverse it if you can yeah and it's a lot of it is a mitochondrial disease we know well the coq10 and others things help with Parkinson's and it's it's actually a mitochondrial problem like many diseases also the interesting is they're also finding a direct connection but they got microbiome and Parkinson's mm-hmm
(45:10) interestingly there were some there's some patients uh dr. Barrett II he had some patients who had C difficile colitis the patient also had Parkinson's that got a stool transplant for their C difficulys cast what the Parkinson's got better Hey Wow yes actually remember reading a study that people who a constipation have a 300 percent increased risk constipation is not benign exactly yeah I mean I mean I had a guy today it was like happen you know like every three or four days I'm like that's not normally is know for me
(45:39) I go every few days I'm like no you should go twice a day he's like twice a day what are you smoking like I think that is is not what people really think of as normal but it it really is right and I think you know I connect the dots the gut the immune system the mitochondria it's all one system everything's connected everything else it's sort of like you know the knee bones connected to the thigh bone all that but it's actually true in the body and we treat people on all these silos with all these specialties yes and
(46:07) unfortunately doesn't help them get to the issues that can really help them get better yeah and I think I think the other the other thing that's also I think really important I've learned this as you know the more experienced I get is I I always go into each patient without what I call a Zen mind very open-minded I don't really you know I just sort of listen and I don't have any preconceived notions of what's going on and if I just you know listen to them make notes you know and try to
(46:32) then connect the dots and that way there's no you know preconceive all I think I think you have this or I think you have that you can even do that in functional medicine like I think you have leaky gutter I think you have glue and well guess what there's no leaky that there's no glue let's look somewhere else maybe you know maybe you've had a tick bite you know maybe you have pesticide poisoning exposure maybe you're glyphosate toxic I mean there's all different than half ways that you can go down and it's it
(46:59) does require you know playing you know detective yeah I remember I yeah I'm thinking that I had a patient who grew up in the Bronx and was very poor and she was an apartment complex where cockroaches Leah spread yeah we're crawling all over her and she hated pests so she moved to the suburbs and she would have the exterminator come every month to spray inside and outside her house and she had an entire barrel like a 50 gallon barrel of chlorine which is now banned in this country and was exposed to this over and over and
(47:32) over and she got Parkinson's at 50 years old yeah and we helped her by detoxifying her by working on her mitochondria and doing all those things we talked about let's intern you say because I remember I distinctly remember reading us an article that was looking at Japanese men and they had a higher incidence of Parkinson's as they ate more fruits and vegetables so the logical conclusion is eat fruits and vegetables get Parkinson's wrong as it pesticides exactly pesticide laden fruits and vegetables I mean farmers are
(48:01) one of the worst the farm workers and was exposed to pesticides in the highest rates of Parkinson's and then they are we and I'm talking about the herbicide roundup the the with the glyphosate and the effects on the gut microbiome that's another big one that's it that's that that to me is probably one of the the big elephants in the room it's a modern to modern day society life is I mean we actually test for glyphosate now is I got my test it you know I don't you have any because I organic and I
(48:27) don't test asides and I'm really careful what I eat but the truth is I travel half the I know I don't always have control right he's at and I checked my ear and I was like holy crap I'm probably in the 50th percentile for glyphosate I thought I'd be in like the 10th percentile yeah and I like this is not good yes exactly and and the other thing that's that it's been touted is they know that glyphosate is safe because it doesn't affect any of the biochemical pathways in the body well lo and behold
(48:54) it actually affects the shekinah pathway which is actually how the bacteria have their metabolism so when you're using glyphosate you're actually messing up the metabolic pathways of bacteria especially gut bacteria yeah it also affects glutathione or other things all those transgenerational effects oh yeah yeah so that's one of things we do here as well we deal with a lot with with understanding how toxins affect the body how to help the body detoxify and and do it in a way which actually creates
(49:20) profound results yeah um you know what what is one of the biggest things you think about when you think about toxins and how do we how do we sort of look at those in our practice and what do we what do we doing see well it's you know there's there I always I actually given talks on toxins with God rest assault Walter Corinne Ian he was a big he died yes he died yeah yeah he died and so in there was a we used to talk together about this seminal article I believe it was in science it was called the expose
(49:53) 'm which is the sum total of all the different toxins that we get exposed to or everything it's our diet stress for microbiome all those are exactly and and to some degree you know there is a little bit of survival of the fittest so the people who can detoxify well will actually survive in modern society better when you sort of like the cockroaches that are resistant to DDT i mean that's that's not me I'm susceptible so so you know the so the toxins that were exposed to probably the one the biggest sources is
(50:26) pharmaceutical industry mmm I consider pharmaceuticals as toxins yes they're they're toxins but just like you know if you know what to give at the poison at the right dose your thing yes makes the point those makes the poison exactly and and with the big dirty secret is that these chemicals you know get peed out and pooped out and they stay go into the water systems and no water systems are actually checking for some of these chemicals hormones antibiotics pharmaceuticals in studies Harley's and totally and and I believe without
(51:00) question that the pharmaceuticals which are everywhere when you look you know people are you know taking you know handfuls of to pharmaceuticals these are getting into the water system and I believe they're actually probably affecting us in in some way so having clean water clean food or some of the ways that which we can you know help with our exposure to toxins yeah I mean grew clean air exactly of iron methyl working group is a resource resource they have all lists of how to avoid toxins in your seafood and your
(51:30) meat and your vegetables and your household cleaning products and your personal care products a great resource ewg oh yeah yeah aw gee exactly yeah and and and just you know being aware of it is is important and I talked earlier jokingly about red wine well the dirty secret about you know California and all the wines in the United States is they're they're filled with pesticides fungicides and glyphosate and arsenic yeah so you you know if you're gonna have wine you want to make sure it's organic or from Europe because they
(51:57) don't allow the same degree that you have in the states I saw this guy had a wine filter the other day like a water filter I was like wow I don't know if it it'll actually filter all that I don't know would try it but but and and again you know and what you know they've shown that you know Cheerios and all these food products you know I have glyphosate in them yeah even some of the things are a quote-unquote organic you can find a glyphosate in them so I just read that the impossible burger which is this
(52:24) plant-based healthy quote soy burger which is GMO soy has 11 times the glyphosate levels of the be on meat which is made from pea protein because soybeans are sprayed with glyphosate Wow that's striking yeah you know and so you try to do something healthy and then you're ending up poisoning yourself vocal actually say biting a soy burger right right yeah and they and I think that you know people people right people are trying to be healthy but sometimes they're they're making the wrong choice or sort of
(52:52) you know like I had this one guy who thought don't you know well you know being a vegetarian is good and eating so he's good so the guy was eating soy burgers tofu burgers and in all the other soy sauce the guy literally grew breasts he was starting to have gynecomastia from all the estrogen effect of the of a mostly the processed soy yeah cuz the whole soy traditionally if you're eating an unreasonable amounts won't do this right right right yeah it was all the process exactly yeah highly processed exactly which we think is
(53:19) going to health food like it tofu I mean a turkey soy thing or a soy bacon or so yeah they're all frankenfoods yeah thanks it's all highly processing it's not all food plant-based diet you know exactly is that yeah so you know just see kinda by the mitochondria going back to for a minute I I was just remembering a patient I had who had heart failure now we think of heart failure is this you know one Wade Street you know you get it it gets worse you try to manage it with a lot of medication but it turns out that it's a
(53:48) mitochondrial problem and you can actually treat it with mitochondrial nutrients and I recently had a guy who was a healthy ish seven year old guy it's all heart failure and he had a number of things going on with him that we treated they were underlying inflammation but I came a bunch of support for his medication ribose and carnitine and cookie 10 and magnesium a bunch of stuff and his ejection fraction which is the strength of what you can pump blood out of your heart went from like 30% which is a few steps away from
(54:18) a heart failure to over 50% which is pretty much normal yeah which is pretty amazing when you see that and it's again not something traditional cardiologists will look oh let me see your mitochondria like they don't know how to think about it or test it or look at it yeah exactly yeah yeah and obviously you know your heart doesn't rest right even when you're sleeping your heart's pumping you hope so might it kind of is really important for for the heart and absolutely you can there are three cases
(54:43) of patients having improvements of heart failure and reversal of heart failure with mitochondrial nutrient support I have many of those cases that's pretty amazing so one of the things that we do also here at the ultra Wellness Center is intravenous nutrition can you talk about know why that's important what it does and who is good for well sure I mean there's you know intravenous nutrition is a catch-all term for giving nutrients through the veins and sort of bypassing the gut for absorption and there are
(55:13) some patients that in them for whatever reason they may not be absorbing their nutrients as well so some of the things that we use here and would include things like the Myers cocktail we might also use them what's a man B vitamins magnesium and you know B vitamins are you know very very you know Bruce Ames is the one who brought my attention to the B vitamins because a lot of people have subclinical genetic deficiencies where they need higher levels of B vitamins so giving B vitamins actually supports mitochondrial function you know
(55:46) when you give these B vitamins and magnesium you can boost the effect of mitochondria through the the Augmented effects and then glutathione intravenously is also a fantastic tool IV vitamin C we use that for a host of different things and when you mention the high B nad yeah IV nad yeah that that I think is actually that's really amazing stuff is really really cool and it's it's so there are patients who do need I don't say that everybody walks through the door needs an IV but if you want to support and people who are
(56:21) sicker people have more unexplained fatigue you can definitely do that it was a study with IV vitamin C and sepsis you know what yeah yeah factor so this is a really interesting thing so IB vitamin C we use it here for patients who have potential cancer infection monarch infections epstein-barr buyers etc flu or whatever it is and so and hide levels vitamin C is actually a pro-oxidant hmm it's not actually an antioxidants actually a pro-oxidant and the interesting thing is that they've been yeah there are some studies out now
(56:55) that if you go into a hospital and you have septic shock your mortality which is normally about 40 percent of people who died in the hospital if you give them IV vitamin C along with I think steroids and a little bit of thiamine the mortality went from 40% to 9% Wow so it's a four-fold decrease in death that's unbelievable yeah and there's no drug that can do that yeah yeah so you go from 10% to or 40% down to about less than 10% mortality pretty amazing it is pretty powerful stuff and it's cheap yeah it's very cheap yeah so
(57:29) you're deaf see a lot of researcher that with big pharma cuz you know they're not gonna make money on it it's true it's it's it's there's a gap in research a lot of things we do know work clinically we've all had experience with for decades doesn't get the funding because the NIH isn't funding it and now there is drug companies so we're kind of stuck having to look at smaller studies or small groups that people are studying this so well we're doing all these things we talked about here at the ultra
(57:52) wanna Center it's it's a really unique practice we have you know for physicians to physician's assistants for nutritionists a whole bunch of nurses and we're taking care of people a team approach where people come in they get this full evaluation where the medical detectives we find problems that most people have struggle to solve for decades and often break quickly we know what to do and and we support them over time with coaching and with encouragement and follow-up visits and it's really a pretty unique
(58:26) center here at the ultra wana Center and and collectively you know we've had probably 60 years of collective experience in practicing functional medicine which is I think pretty unique in the world we're getting older but it weirder skin smarter and you know we've all personally had challenges with our health and we've used this model to really help recover and I remember when I was really sick you and dr.
(58:48) Bowman came over to my house and you know helped me think through what was going on my brain wasn't working because my gut wasn't working and it's it's just so rewarding to see these patients you had you at a recent case that you wanted to share about Alzheimer's right yeah a fantastic case it was a patient who I saw who came down from up north in Canada and was given a diagnosis up there of having Alzheimer's and was pretty much sold you know you know get your affairs in order it's your fairs norm - exactly and
(59:15) there's not much we can do for you so he came down the treatment for Alzheimer's is a lawyer he's a lawyer Yeah right every a rabbi a priest right yeah so patient came down and I saw her with her husband and did a complete workup and as you know through some of the writings of the dáil bredesen and also a functional medicine approach is that and Alzheimer's well the ultra mind solution was really good yeah that was it that wasn't about Alice I'm result no but it was oh yeah oh yeah brain yeah right
(59:47) yeah so so in and I love the analogy I wrote that by the way yeah the the analogy of Alice embers is like a roof with 32 holes in it and you know you're not gonna fix it but just you know doing one hole so I did a full workup on the patient and the other thing which most doctors and even dentists aren't aware is the role of the oral bacteria yeah there's actually some really interesting studies that when you have bad bacteria in your mouth yeah gingivitis periodontal disease performance gingivalis it highly causes
(1:00:18) systemic inflammation which in turn affects the brain and causes brain inflammation and brain deterioration over time so her workup included checking for heavy metals checking for herpes viruses because herpes simplex is also associated with with that checking for the a belief for genotype as predisposes you but doesn't predestined you exactly just because you have it doesn't mean you're gonna get it but you're one of those people has a more robust immune response so you have more inflammation which is great on a
(1:00:46) short-term but on a long-term basis you don't want chronic inflammation so she had a whole bunch of things she had some mercury she had some oral bacteria she had some gut bacteria she had some gluten issues she had herpes simplex a they believed for genotype so I sort of worked on all of those things we also changed her diet and within a matter of months her husband said I have my wife back Wow yeah she was now able to converse to talk she can drive by herself now she literally stopped and reverses the effects of Alzheimer's right exactly
(1:01:20) yeah it's pretty pretty what do you think it was of all those things that you did or was it all the holes it was all the holes exactly it was in and we you know we thought about root cause it's actually root causes so I think there's an often - sometimes there's one big one but then there's all these other things that are supporting that also play a role so I just addressed all of them in like a like a checklist fashion you know it's interesting you say that because you know traditional medicine
(1:01:43) it's there's you know sort of the joke about neurology is diagnosan adios you know here's what you got nothing to do I'll see you later and I think it's certainly the approach now with Alzheimer's because we've spent billions of dollars on hundreds and hundreds of studies with nothing to show for it it's because we've been looking down the wrong path because we've been we've been looking at amyloid plaques which are a hallmark of actual inflammation slash infection in
(1:02:10) the brain just like cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease less well does not cause heart disease inflammation causes heart disease cholesterol is a bystander yes trying to repair that inflammatory process expanding right so so beta amyloid in the brain isn't actually an anti microbial peptide it tells you that the body is trying to fight off some type of infection be it a spirochete from Lyme disease syphilis a virus or a fungi yeah so that's you know so yeah I need amyloid you know we've we've we've
(1:02:39) been saying if we get rid of the beta a I'm gonna find a drug to remove the beta it's the wrong thinking it's the problem and in functional medicine here at Ultra wonder we do a different kind of thinking which is what are all the treatable things that we can find that could help this patient's health get better in general and that also helps the brain get better so it's not to say that we can come in here in cure-all case of Alzheimer's that's not true but we can certainly uh Nitin let me
(1:03:04) especially if you're far advanced but we can certainly if we get early enough we can help to slow down and maybe even reverse some of the effects by using this approach absolutely not only have you found this I found this and dozens and dozens of other doctors doing this approach across the country have done this and yet it's still in the outside of health care well you know it's also really interesting is I'm seeing more and more doctors and nurses who are in mainstream medicine coming to see me
(1:03:31) because and they're in there in like some of the best hospitals best centers because they can't get help in their system know for sure you know I ask you a lot of our patients our health care exactly yeah and and and I think I think you know when a physician has either themselves or a close family member or spouse or whatever get a condition and you're you're butting your head against the wall with the mainstream approach that's where you start you know you sort of fall into functional medicine because this does not working I
(1:04:03) gotta I gotta find more put more tools in my tool bag yeah well that's the thing here at they'll join us and we have a lot of tools we have a different way of thinking we work as a team and we've been doing it for a long time so if you're listening and you suffer with some chronic thing that hasn't gotten better or you have any one of those diseases or conditions we talked about or pretty much anything yeah we can really make a difference in helping people find the root cause be medical detectives and help people create a
(1:04:31) pathway that it gets them back to health and that's really the goal here yeah and and the other thing is I you know so many practices have what I call protocols and protocols are sort of like you do the same thing over and over for everyone and we don't really have protocols here we have certain things that we do use other than a lot of patients rubbish we have an approach but we don't have a rubber stamp you know you're not gonna come in read the ultra Wellness Center everybody gets the same
(1:04:53) treatment that doesn't work right not exactly because it's different for everybody it's it's is ours is very much personalized in proactive and and a deep dive into nutritional biochemical genetic toxic biology yeah as you mentioned with that case with MMS you know that's one case with MS another case might be very different yeah I think thinking what you saw that patient with Alzheimer's someone else with Alzheimer's might need a very different approach exactly so that's really the
