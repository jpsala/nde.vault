- **Sumarize the dr advices in the following transcript:**

The main advice given by the doctor in the transcript can be summarized as follows:

Identify root causes: The doctor emphasizes the importance of identifying the underlying causes of autoimmune diseases. Each person may have different factors contributing to their condition, so it's essential to investigate and treat them individually.

Lifestyle changes: Making fundamental lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications, can have a significant impact on improving symptoms and even reversing autoimmune diseases.

Individualized treatment: Autoimmune diseases vary from person to person, even if they have the same diagnosis. It's crucial to treat each individual based on their specific factors and needs.

Address inflammation: The doctor focuses on understanding and addressing the root causes of inflammation in the body, which is a common factor in autoimmune diseases. They highlight the importance of functional medicine in examining why inflammation occurs.

Gut health: The doctor emphasizes the role of gut health in autoimmune diseases. They mention the significance of addressing dysbiosis, leaky gut, and bacterial overgrowth, which can contribute to inflammation and autoimmune responses.

Importance of functional medicine: The doctor advocates for a functional medicine approach that looks beyond conventional care and aims to uncover the underlying causes of autoimmune diseases. Functional medicine focuses on personalized treatment, understanding the patient's story, and listening to their experiences.

Diet and nutrition: The doctor recommends dietary changes, such as eliminating inflammatory foods, processed foods, gluten, and dairy. They also mention the potential benefits of supplements like fish oil, vitamin D, and probiotics in supporting gut health and reducing inflammation.

Sleep and stress management: Adequate sleep and stress reduction are essential for supporting the immune system and overall health, particularly for individuals with autoimmune diseases.

Rehabilitation and remodeling of the gut: In cases where the gut has been compromised, the doctor mentions the importance of rehabilitating and remodeling the gut through dietary changes and potentially using therapies like worm therapy.

Avoidance of triggers: The doctor advises individuals with autoimmune diseases to identify and avoid triggers that worsen their symptoms, such as certain foods or environmental toxins.

Hope and progress: The doctor reassures individuals that there is hope for progress and improvement in autoimmune diseases. They mention that with the right approach, including diet, lifestyle changes, and potential support from a functional medicine doctor, significant improvements can be achieved.

Resources: The doctor recommends the 10-day detox diet as a starting point for dietary changes. They also mention the availability of online solutions and resources for affordable and accessible support. Additionally, they suggest exploring scientific data and doing personal research to better understand autoimmune conditions and potential treatments.

## All Transcript:
(00:00) we can not only improve the symptoms the dietary change some fundamental lifestyle changes and a few supplements can make a huge difference we can literally reverse it and get people to lose the diagnosis let's start with the basics what are five of the top things top things that people are doing that you can think of that contribute to the root factors that drive autoimmune disease so from a functional medicine perspective we're always thinking about the cause and there are basically five causes of autoimmune disease pretty much all
(00:38) disease but particularly autoimmune disease and most traditional medicine just ignores those causes and gives medications that shut off the immune system so when i'm thinking about someone with inflammation i'm thinking about what's causing the immune system to be pissed off and it's a short list it's toxins and that can be heavy metals pesticides mycotoxins any kind of toxin either internal toxin or external toxin allergens and that can be food sensitivities it can be gluten it can be dairy so foods and environmental
(01:11) triggers and microbes so that would be everything from your microbiome which we're going to talk about to things like tick infections and viral infections all can trigger autoimmune disease poor diet which is basically our sad diet our standard american diet which is highly inflammatory and stress and that can be psychological stress or physical stresses all those trigger inflammation and autoimmune disease so my job as a doctor is to hunt down the rabbit holes of each of those areas and find out what that particular person
(01:41) has because everybody's different you can have 10 people with exactly the same autoimmune disease and might have 10 different factors causing it and you need to treat them all differently now out of the ones that you mentioned are there a few that you're seeing in this time that we're in that are the primary contributors if you had to take a few of those because they all can play a part but which ones are the biggest driver for 80 of the people that are out there that you see well number one two and three my mind is
(02:07) gluten if someone's got an autoimmune disease that's until proven otherwise a factor because it drives not only systemic inflammation but it causes leaky gut and the second thing is dysbiosis which is imbalances in the gut flora that cause leaky gut it could be gluten or other things that drives inflammation and the third thing i think is probably the the hidden infections that are affecting so many people particularly tick infections and then of course there's all the secondary things that i mentioned whether it's mold or whether
(02:39) it's heavy metals or environmental toxins all those drive the inflammation so give us a sense of how big is this you know i can think about five ten years ago you were just starting to hear a lot more about autoimmune conditions and i think that anybody who's watching this podcast on youtube or listening on audio they may not get how big this classification of diseases are so what do you know from the stats that are out there well the problem with looking at autoimmune disease is that it's so siloed so the neurologist takes care of
(03:12) multiple sclerosis the gastroenterologist takes care of inflammatory bowel disease the endocrinologist takes care of hashimoto's and the rheumatologist takes care of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis so everybody's looking at their little autoimmune disease and their specialty and not understanding the scope of the problem when you zoom out and you look at autoimmune disease it's probably 80 million people which is almost as many people as have diabetes heart disease and cancer combined so now you guys take that in this is the
(03:44) single biggest threat facing americans today and i say americans because in other parts of the world where indigenous cultures are within the developing world they don't have as much autoimmune disease because they don't have the same environment that we do they are more in the dirt they have more exposure to parasites they have more exposure to stuff that makes their immune system smarter when we've hyper hygienized ourselves and our food's purified and we're not playing in farms and dirts
(04:11) when we're exposed to all the horrible diet we have in america all these factors drive this pandemic of autoimmune disease in america which is why we're probably also seeing it grow in other parts of the world even though it's in lower numbers because we're exporting this american lifestyle out there which is very sad and we got to do something about it which is what this podcast is all about absolutely so how do you even begin you know all the things you shared earlier can feel quite overwhelming even i'm sure for
(04:37) other physicians which there are some physicians that watch this podcast how do you even begin to uncover the root causes of autoimmune diseases you have a patient that's coming in maybe they have a diagnosis maybe they don't how do you even get started from step one well after doing functional medicine for 30 years i do the same thing i've done every day for 30 years which is use the matrix which is a map of how the body works from a functional medicine perspective so i look at all the predisposing factors those five things
(05:04) and i dig deep into those i look at their lifestyle look at their mind body stress and i come up with what are their issues so it's a detailed history um i just gave a his example from yesterday had a young girl 26 years old inflammatory arthritis she's also got terrible bacterial overgrowth in her gut and ibs or irritable bowel syndrome migraines fatigue all kinds of symptoms and she was actually sent to me by a rheumatologist at cleveland clinic because they're like hey maybe you can help her because this is pretty complex
(05:35) and for her we looked at mold we looked at toxins we looked at her gut we looked at infections we look at all these things through diagnostic testing and we found a lot of stuff she didn't really have mold but she had the highest lead level i've ever seen and it may be coming from the environment she lived in and maybe in london she also had four infections lyme disease erlichia which is another tick infection cmb which is cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus they were hot so she had toxins she had infections and she also
(06:10) had bacterial overgrowth in her gut of a methane producing bacteria that causes leaky gut inflammation and the whole dysbiosis that drives inflammation so for her fixing her is getting rid of her infections getting rid of her metals and fixing her gut now for somebody else it might be mold or it might been you know organotoxins not heavy metals or it might have been gluten it was a factor for her it wasn't so we really have to look at each person individually and then we can map it out so it's really through a detailed
(06:37) history looking at toxin exposure tick infections mold exposure nutritional status dietary history various triggers insults you know sometimes people were traveling in thailand they got a bug in their gut and it caused some disruption that led to sort of long-term inflammatory issues so we basically do a medical detective approach like sherlock holmes and dig down into these areas based on their medical history and then based on the history we'll do deep dives into diagnostics around toxins allergies infections diet and so forth
(07:06) now you talked about this a little bit but how does conventional medicine typically approach an autoimmune patient somebody who has autoimmune how do they think about that and you've already shared a little about functional medicine but it'd be nice to just tease that out a little bit more in conventional medicine and what are some basic core distinctions that are well intentioned in conventional medicine but completely misguided when it comes to the fundamental basics of autoimmune yeah i mean i think
(07:33) i think that the real fundamental difference is in traditional conventional care the approach is to diagnose based on symptoms where is the symptom and you know what is the symptom do you have for example joint pain you go dermatologists you have a stomach inflammatory valves you go to the gastrologist no one's asking why they're asking what what disease do you have what category do you fit in and the joke if you actually even ask rheumatology they go well most people don't fit into these narrow categories of these diagnostic
(08:03) criteria that we've developed that we use to study these these illnesses they're actually more mushy uh and i you know i think they're not asking how this disease arose or simply saying oh you have this disease and then our job then is to shut off the inflammation i'm more interested in getting to the cause of the inflammation and getting rid of it you know in functional medicine we talk about the tact rules this is from sidney baker he said when you're standing on attack it takes a lot of astro to make it feel better and if
(08:30) you're standing on two tacks you have to take both of them out because taking one of them out won't make you 50 better so there may be multiple causes i mean if you have a broken ankle i can give you morphine and you can walk around the room and go hike a mountain but probably not a good idea so traditional care is essentially saying how do we shut off inflammation and they have a number of tools prednisone is the most crude tool sort of a general anti-inflammatory with terrible side effects and it was the
(08:54) mainstay of rheumatology treatment for decades and then we started using chemotherapy drugs like methotrexate or cyclosporn or others that are used for you know transplant rejection and very intense drugs that shut off your immune system chemo drugs and then we started using biologics which are a great advance and they do help a lot of people but they also suppress your immune system so things like humera and brill these various drugs are super expensive they're called tnf alpha blockers they cost about fifty thousand dollars a year
(09:24) and what they do is they suppress the inflammatory response in the body so even though you have this trigger it's shutting it off for example even though you're a broken ankle you'd have pain unless you took a morphine or heroin to shut it off right so they they can control the symptoms but don't address the root cause and these drugs can suppress your immune system and lead to cancer and lead to overwhelming infection and death they're not they're not benign drugs so from a functional medicine
(09:50) perspective we look at why is there inflammation now i just hear another story of a young girl who came to see me isabelle who was 10 years old and she had something called mixed connective tissue disorder meaning everything was on fire uh her muscles were on fire her arteries and veins were on fire her joints were on fire her skin was on fire everything was on fire and all she had a whole host of antibodies autoimmune antibodies she had high crp her liver was affected her blood cells were affected it was just a systemic inflammation disease and
(10:21) they were giving her methotrexate which is a chemo drug and they were giving her high doses of intravenous steroids called cellul every three weeks ib just just so she could get to school like she wasn't better but she was just managing it and instead of asking you know what other drugs should i give her i'm like what's causing this so i just went down the rabbit hole and looked at her her story and she ate junk food her whole life tons of sugar and she had to she was 10 but she loved raw fish and she
(10:48) ate tons of sushi and tuna tons of sugar had lots of antibiotics and so i figured oh she's probably got a little heavy metals she's probably got yeast issues because of all the sugar and antibiotics she's probably got dysbiosis so when we dug under the hood we found she had gluten antibodies she had high levels of mercury and she had significant nutritional deficiencies like vitamin d which was important for regulating autoimmunity and she um she had terrible dysbiosis and imbalances in her gut and inflammation
(11:14) in her gut which she didn't have gut symptoms but when we looked at the tests we could see that she was serving this pre-inflammatory bowel state so her gut was a mess so we fixed her gut we got off gluten in dairy we got off the sugar and processed foods we get rid of our metals and we gave her some nutritional support basically fish oil vitamin d two months later she comes back and she's completely symptom free and getting off her medications and by the way she was on a lot of medication she was on medications to
(11:41) support her blood vessels from being irritated called the phetipine which is the calcium channel blocker that she used for blood pressure but it was just so she could actually not have raynaud's she was on uh drugs for her stomach and reflux she was on drugs for blood thinners like aspirin she was on a whole host of drugs at 10 years old just to manage the effects of this disease and in two months she was off of all that in a year she was off everything and had no symptoms and all of her auto antibodies
(12:07) went to normal now most rheumatologists will say do not bother to check antibodies after you first diagnose the patient because they never go away that is not true if you know what to do they go away and i've seen this over and over over decades and it's because we don't get rid of the cause that they don't go away when you get rid of the cause they'll go away and so after a year all her massively abnormal lab tests went back to normal except for one kind of minor auto antibody and i talked
(12:32) to her it was about 10 years later i called her up like how are you doing you know like i was curious i'm great i'm in university i'm doing great and no symptoms so that's the potential of using this model now on the topic of the body and the body being on fire you started off this master class with the five top things that you felt are the primary drivers of the root causes for autoimmune but they all have a common link and that link is inflammation really help us drive home that connection between inflammation and
(13:01) autoimmune diseases well you know we're all familiar with inflammation you cut your finger gets infected it gets red swollen hot painful that's those are the signs of inflammation and so that red hot swollen painful happens not just on your skin but it happens inside and that's inflammation and that's what drives autoimmune disease so it's it's a final common pathway for so many diseases across the age spectrum but it's a particular kind of inflammation so heart disease is inflammatory diabetes is inflammatory
(13:31) autism is inflammatory alzheimer's inflammatory depression is inflammatory those are not typically autoimmune diseases so inflammation can be of many types the particular type that you get with autoimmune disease is where you create auto antibodies literally you are attacking yourself it's not something outside of you that's attacking you it's you create an antibody response to your own tissues so your body starts attacking your joints or your nerves in ms or your stomach in inflammatory bowel disease or your
(13:57) thyroid and hashimoto's which by the way is super common affects one in five women one in ten men half of them are not diagnosed and probably another three quarters are poorly treated so that's a huge problem but the the ability for the body to recover from this is is really important to understand because most people when they get diagnosed with autoimmune disease they're told this is a lifelong problem you will always have this we will have to manage it with immune suppressing medication and hopefully you'll be all right it's
(14:28) basically how it's done and the reality is that we can not only improve the symptoms not only stop it but we can literally reverse it and get people to lose the diagnosis of autoimmune disease you can say it's in remission it'll come back sure i mean if you're eating gluten and you cut off gluten and your administration goes away you eat the gluten it's going to come back right so you have to kind of be aware of what are your triggers and we're all a little bit different and need to pay attention to what our unique
(14:53) differences are about what we need to avoid or we need to do to manage the autoimmunity but the truth is that once you heal things the body is so resilient and robust and and so there's so much that we now understand about how autoimmune disease works but it's not necessarily incorporated into traditional care yet and uh what's really heartening to me is i see rheumatologists start to start to get into this i was i was uh i was talking to one from ucla cedar sinai and i was asked to speak to him because
(15:24) one of my patients also was seeing him and i thought oh well you know it's going to be a challenging conversation he's going to question everything i'm doing he's going to blah blah blah blah i get on the phone he's like dr hi man i'm so glad to talk to you i've been using your approach i'm using anti-inflammatory diets with the traditional treatments and we're getting such better results way better than we ever got so i see the crack in the in the edifice of our modern medical care
(15:47) system around autoimmune disease it's just not fast enough for me because i see so many people suffer needlessly and we do understand in-depth inflammation and so by using the model of functional medicine we can help people to remove the causes of inflammation and then put in the things in the body that help regulate the immune system whether it's vitamin d or fish oil probiotics there's a whole bunch of stuff that's on the positive end that we have to add in just so we have to take out the stuff that's causing problems we
(16:13) have to add in the things that help the immune system work better now you give us a great sense of hope because the landscape is changing but it's also changing slowly and there are great functional medicine practitioners out there but a lot of them uh especially in the last year they're not taking on new patients they're overloaded you're not taking on new patients it's very challenging and people are trying to get help and trying to navigate so for the person that doesn't have access
(16:38) and is trying to figure out the steps that they can take can they still have hope that there's progress that they can make and stuff that they can do on their own with of course the support of their doctor that they have currently oh my god yes i mean most of the causes of autoimmunity can be managed without the help of a doctor so let's start off with the first one which is diet yes so the reason that i write the books that i write is to give people access to the science of functional medicine without
(17:02) having to see a functional medicine practitioner and i can't tell you drew how many times people have come up to me said dr hyman you saved my life last night i was going to dinner in l.a and someone stopped me so my dad read all your books he had all these issues and automated and he's cured everything and thank you so it's not that you have to necessarily see a functional medicine practitioner to get better sometimes you do but for the most part if you start with food because that's the biggest trigger i
(17:26) would say for autoimmunity and do what i have written as the 10-day detox diet or what we now call the 10-day reset the book i wrote was designed to help people remove the inflammatory foods from their diet and add in the anti-inflammatory foods and to help fix their gut help boost detoxification and help the the sort of microbiome get back to normal that alone can work for so many many people so essentially what i would say is and there's a whole there's a whole um a bunch of science looking at these kinds of approaches around diet
(18:00) one of them is about inflammatory bowel disease they call it the autoimmune paleo diet which is very similar to 10-day detox diet which essentially gets rid of grains beans dairy sugar processed food and it also gets sort of eggs nightshades and nuts which can be triggers for some people i don't remove eggs nightstand nuts for most people because they're not it's not that common but if you really want to go extreme you can do that and then you add things back and and one guy came up to me at a lecture at cleveland clinic he
(18:26) said dr hyman i have rheumatoid arthritis and i did your 10-day detox diet and all my symptoms went away is that possible i'm like yes if it was something you're eating now if you have mercury poisoning or if you have a tick infection or you have mold exposure mold exposure you're not going to necessarily get all the way better but you will improve and you still have to do the gut repair which is really kind of easy to do on your own basically for most people if you just do the 10-day detox diet for 10 days
(18:54) you'll see whether or not what you're eating is driving inflammation and for most people it is that's the first step and then there are ways to sort of navigate these other aspects around heavy metals toxins gut and you sometimes may need to see a functional medicine doctor but what i'm finding is now there are solutions that are coming up online there's a lot of things that are affordable and accessible you don't actually necessarily have to kind of go see a physician sometimes you will but for most people it's worth a
(19:19) try to start just with diet and lifestyle exercise stress reduction sleep some basic supplements are really helpful so getting people on probiotics getting them on omega-3 fats getting them on vitamin d simple things can make a big difference for people by just resetting their biology now most physicians again well-intentioned and sometimes maybe not well-intentioned but most physicians well-intentioned is well-intentioned they see a lot of those recommendations interventions as sort of soft recommendations right
(19:49) nothing wrong with it but it's not going to do anything for you why is that with all the education with all the background with everything that's there why is it that still those are seen as soft when it comes to diet sleep and exercise and some of these other things that you just mentioned it's astounding to me how much data there is right and and physicians often hide behind the veil what we call evidence-based medicine and that is often a sort of deflection from having to do the hard work of looking at the data because
(20:17) if you go on pubmed in the national library medicine and you search for diet not immunity exercise i mean sleeping on immunity stress immunity various vitamins omega-3 vitamin d you'll see there's plenty of data but no one's put all the dots together and that's what functional medicine does so for for people who are skeptical i would say look just do your homework you know go look at the data we need more obviously but but there's a huge start and we did a preliminary analysis that was done by
(20:42) the rheumatology department at cleveland clinic we didn't actually look at the data so it was sort of at arm's length and we had a fellow from the rheumatology department looked at our patients at the center for functional medicine and then their patients and and cleveland clinic is i think the number two in the world in rheumatology so they're not like a third-rate rheumatologist these are the best docs in the world and in our docs at the center did better with those rheumatoid arthritis and ceramic arthritis patients across a
(21:11) number of metrics that are standardized validated metrics from the rheumatology they got better in terms of pain inflammation symptoms and so forth so there's a there there and i think there's a real awareness that there's there's a need to sort of incorporate some of these things and i think when i hear these stories of other rheumatologists starting to come on board and other people thinking about how to actually use diet and lifestyle and how effective it is it's it's important and i think the
(21:37) reason we've sort of had this soft idea about it because nutrition has been the step child of of medicine it's like well okay if you don't use much and you won't maybe get overweight and blah blah blah but there really isn't a sense that it's that powerful and when you look at the science around food as medicine it works better than a drug like i listen drew i i don't care what the therapy is if i thought a biologic was going to be the best therapy for this patient i'd recommend it
(22:06) i'm agnostic i'm not pro or anti-drug i'm pro finding out the root cause and addressing that i'm pro creating health and seeing what happens and when you do that these problems just tend to go away and we don't have to go in that rabbit hole of medication so i i think we're we're kind of in this threshold moment where there's a real understanding that the microbiome is involved in so much autoimmune disease and yet when you go to the rheumatologist to the neurologist or the gi doctor they're not
(22:35) actually looking at your your diet uh and it's just sort of stunning to me that they're not or they're not looking at your microbiome uh when you go after rheumatoid arthritis you go to the rheumatologist like let me look at your poop or when you go to the neurologist when you have ms they're like let me look at your poop and i remember god it probably was 25 years ago i had an ms patient at canyon ranch when i was working there and she said to me dr hyman whenever my stomach and irritable bowel gets worse
(23:01) my ms gets worse i'm like oh noted so you begin to go to these rabbit holes of listening to patients and listening their stories and the problem with medicine is we come up with preconceived ideas about what's going on instead of actually listening to our patients and most of what i've learned i haven't learned in a textbook i've learned from you know being on the street working with thousands and thousands of patients doing thousands and thousands maybe millions of tests and seeing all the
(23:26) patterns in there and i remember one guy who had severe ulcerative colitis early on and i was like oh we're doing the for our program or the time now it's a five hour program to rebuild the gut and put an elimination diet all things i thought should work and fish oil and this and that he just didn't get better he's losing weight he was having bloody diarrhea it was just miserable and i said well you know let me go back and look at what the causes are so let's look at heavy metals let's look at all
(23:49) the potential immunotoxic things that are out there and we thought his mercury was off the chart and i just detoxed him from mercury and his ulcerative colitis went away wow powerful now you talked about diet you mentioned a little bit about testing again a lot of that testing is going to have to happen with uh participation from a doctor an integrative doctor a functional medicine doctor not all these doctors are trained in in these tests what about supplements where can supplements be a part of the picture and in some instances where may
(24:18) they not be helping when it comes to autoimmune so i think they're part of the therapy package but if like the same rule applies if you're standing on attack it takes a lot of aspirin to make it feel better if you're if you've got lyme disease and that's causing you autoimmunity takes a lot of vitamin d to make you feel better right or fish oil or whatever so when i think about immunity i'm thinking how do i how do i one uh help the body's own immune system do what it's supposed to do
(24:44) and there are there are basic fundamental ingredients for regulating inflammation in the body the biggest is the the omega-3 fatty acids that come from mostly wild things right wild fish wild plants wild animals we don't eat that much anymore except wild fish and that's primarily our source of omega-3 fats and yet many people don't eat enough fish or they eat fish and it's got heavy metals in it so it's problematic so omega-3 deficiency probably affects 90 plus percent maybe 98 of americans
(25:14) the second category would be vitamin d which regulates hundreds of genes that control inflammation so having adequate vitamin d is very important and it's been linked to for example ms we know that people have low vitamin d have more ms and it's more common in northern climates where there's low sunlight so we know vitamin e plays a role in autoimmunity and and inflammation uh probiotics are also extremely helpful because they help to normalize the gut now if you have a bad overgrowth of bacteria you can get into problems if
(25:43) you take probiotics but it can be very helpful in normalizing the gut and there's all sorts of anti-inflammatory probiotics and and that's a big rabbit hole we can go down another conversation but it's it's think about precision probiotics it's not just like oh take lactobacillus and that's it there's really different probiotics that do different things for different conditions and then uh and then there's a class of compounds that are more kind of uh immune regulatory that are that are
(26:08) phytochemical so there's a whole class of polyphenols that are plant compounds that regulate inflammation for example curcumin or turmeric we've heard a lot about that so that's probably the most potent one but there's there's many all the pro anthocyanins from colorful fruits and vegetables all the purple and blues and yellows and oranges and greens they all have anti-inflammatory effects and so i make sure i include a lot of those in my diet and spices are great to use for that so we start to begin to
(26:37) take those so i i i also look at ways to sort of regulate my gut health and and keep my inner garden healthy you know we're coming out with a product called gut food which is designed to rebuild your gut how do we feed our inner garden how do we take care of that and that's what the purpose of this new product is how do we how do we establish a healthy microbiome and i'm excited how people are going to do on that because it's one of those areas that is a little messy and there's not a lot of great simple solutions so
(27:05) we really have the potential at any time to rebuild our gut and that's another part of the supplementation is how do we create a healthy gut and that because vitamin a and facial and vitamin d and various nutrients like quercetin and and even things like um like amino acids like glutamine so we sort of put together a cocktail of things to help help rebuild the gut now you mentioned sleep earlier and sleep is one of those things that doesn't get as much attention as it deserves now you've done a whole free
(27:34) sleep master class like completely free people can sign up we'll put the link to that in the show notes it's dr hyman.com sleep but give us a couple high level components for sleep and it's direct connection with recovering from autoimmune so sleep is one of those things that uh you know when i was in surgery in medical school rotations they would say well you know real surgeons don't need sleep right and and i i've used up all my sleep credits in life and it's it definitely drives inflammation you can feel it if
(28:03) you don't sleep i remember working in the emergency room all night or delivering babies and i would be so sore and achy and stiff and i felt like my whole body was inflamed and i would have to go manage that by sleeping or i would go take a hot tub or something and i think we we understand that that if you have sleep deprivation it creates a cascade of dysregulation body hormonal cognitive and inflammatory immune and so sleep is among the best medicines why do you think when you have the flu or when you're a viral infection you tend to
(28:32) sleep a lot because your body requires that to repair and heal to activate your immune response so getting high quality sleep and enough sleep is super important if you have any kind of autoimmune disease and generally for everybody by the way yeah across the board beneficial but especially if you're dealing with any kind of disease like an autoimmune disease i mean particularly you know even your brain you know you have a an immune system in your brain called the microglia and the lymphatic system which is like
(28:57) the lymph system of your brain it only works at night when you're asleep so to clear out all the waste and the garbage and all the things that affect us we need sleep so we have a few questions from our community that have come in and we're going to rapid fire go through a few of them before we go into the final thoughts on all things auto immune diseases so the first question that's here from our community which is any connections between autoimmune and lots of allergies somebody who's suffering
(29:21) from a lot of allergies and has autoimmune yeah so so just to back up a little bit um you know in functional medicine we look at the timeline of someone's illness from before conception the mother's health to what happened in utero at birth in the first year of life in the early toddler years we look at that whole timeline and what's fascinating to me is and i don't see this described many places but there's a continuum that happens and the story always goes something like this okay my mother and the pregnancy was
(29:54) fine born by c-section not breastfed my gut was a mess as a kid a colic early antibiotics for ear infections a development of allergies asthma eczema irritable bowel syndrome this is the story and it's the same freaking story over and over again and then that goes on usually in people's early childhood teens 20s starts to get worse and then by 30s and 40s that's when autoimmune tends to kick in and it's part of that continuum and often when i treat the the gut the and the the autoimmune stuff the allergy stuff gets better the the
(30:29) sensitivities to foods environmental allergens get better even when someone's got like pollen allergy or tree allergies you think that wouldn't get better but when you fix the gut everything gets down regulated uh and there's there's a big connection there's also an interesting connection with a therapy that sounds really weird but there's a lot of research on this and there's a number of books written about it and one is called the epidemic of absence and it's using worms to
(30:55) actually help reset the immune system in the gut because historically we were all managing all kinds of critters that we lived with in our gut that we kind of had his balance with and our immune system was always kind of surveying and looking and managing and keeping everything under control well now we've sort of eliminated all the worms the parasites we have clean water we have sanitation which is all great i'm not saying we should go back to you know eat a lot of worm but there are um there are a number
(31:21) of studies that look at using a worm therapy which helps to reset the gut to reduce allergies but also autoimmunity and i've had some remarkable success uh there was one kid who was sort of on the asperger's autism spectrum who had super high levels of allergies ige allergies like which is true allergy not like a food sensitivity and like the blood level of thousands normal is 100 of ige which is the antibody for allergies and we did the worm therapy and it came down to normal and his allergies went away i was like wow okay and we've seen
(31:53) this in other autoimmune disease so it's it's not my first line therapy but it is something that i fall back on if we get stuck and so regulating the gut and regulating those allergies really helps to control inflammation in general and the whole autoimmunity picture great so my son has celiac and graves disease any tips on supporting and reversing this process well all the things that we just mentioned above absolutely so so you know often people have two or three autoimmune diseases and and it's stunning to me how
(32:24) traditional medicine doesn't ask why like is this just coincidence or is there a reason well yes celiac will drive graves disease so if you actually heal the gut with celiac you often can reverse the graves disease the problem is that with celiac often people just get rid of the wheat or the gluten but they don't rebuild the gut and and i've seen many many people struggling even after getting off gluten because their guts have been so messed up they need a they need a rehab they need a remodel in
(32:50) there and so when you do that often people get better okay next question how bad is alcohol for autoimmune diseases well it depends on what alcohol right there's spirits beer and wine let's see the the the more alcohol you drink the more it disrupts the microbiome the more it leads to leaky gut the more it drives inflammation so having a shot of tequila here and there probably isn't a problem if you're in balance but if you have an autoimmune disease alcohol can be a real factor in continuing to trigger the inflammatory
(33:26) response in the body it is a toxin the dose makes the poison obviously but but it if you're picking if you're drinking beer which is gluten-based if you're drinking a lot of wine which has sulfites um you know a lot of sugar can cause dysbiosis and a lot of uh leaky gut issues and liver problems so i think it depending on where you are in the spectrum of your health it's good to avoid alcohol but you're going to have autoimmune disease now if you the whole purpose of functional medicine is not to make people's life
(33:54) restricted and constrained and to get off of everything and to live in this bubble the purpose is to create resilience to create balance to create redundancy metabolic flexibility and make you robust so you can have a wide variety of things and your body knows what to do so when i was really sick i had autoimmune disease i couldn't anything i like had turkey brown rice and broccoli for a year like and i couldn't eat anything else and now i can eat anything everything i think if i have traditional dairy like
(34:21) modern cow dairy i get stomach issues and i get like pimples and congestion but if i have sheep or goat that's a2 casein that's maybe heirloom strains that's uh you know pasture raised i don't have problems so it really depends on the quality of the food but i definitely think the purpose is to create a robust system that makes you resilient and not have to be so restricted all great answers mark thank you for that you wanna know my secret for living a long and happy and healthy life well all you have to do is check out my
(34:50) weekly newsletter mark's picks where i share my favorite tips for health longevity well-being and lots more check it out and the link below so let's zoom out and do a recap on the topic of autoimmune if someone is going to start today first one or two things that they should be thinking about and next steps let's do a recap on some of the stuff that you mentioned i think the first thing to recognize if you had an autoimmune disease is that there is an approach that's different than what you're going to hear from your
(35:16) traditional rheumatologist and it's easy to start and if the beginning things don't work there's always plan b which is seeing a functional medicine doctor but for many people a dietary change some fundamental lifestyle changes and a few supplements can make a huge difference so what diet well i would recommend an elimination diet now i used one that i created called the 10-day detox diet and essentially it's no grains no beans no dairy no sugar no processed food and it includes lots of phytochemically
(35:49) rich plant foods high quality protein nuts and seeds some fruit and and it gets rid of all the junk and that alone can make a huge difference even if it doesn't get people all the way better it can dramatically improve symptoms for people the second is make sure you focus on stress and sleep those will help your immune system regulate and the third thing is take a few basic supplements vitamin d fish oil probiotics curcumin those are easy to take they're safe they're effective and they will help your body start to
(36:22) rebuild its natural defenses against inflammation so i think those are the those are the things that i would say are the top three things focus on diet lifestyle and a few supplements if that doesn't work and after two or three weeks you are still seeing no change it means you got to dig deeper it means maybe you have a tick infection maybe there's mappy metals maybe you're exposed to mold maybe there's some more serious gut issues going on like sibo or sifo which is fungal overgrowth maybe there's a
(36:48) parasite we have to kind of look deeper but for most people that initial approach can make a huge difference all right dr hyman perfect breakdown of autoimmune conditions and we have our next steps that are out there and the 10 day detox detox diet which we'll link to in the show notes is a great place for people to get started any other couple resources that are out there that you might drive people towards when it comes to going down the pathway of autoimmune conditions any top interviews from your podcast previously that you want to
(37:13) highlight yes all you have to do is google dr hyman autoimmune and you will have more than enough information to start with or you can google ms or you can google hashimoto's or you can google anything that pretty much i've written about it over the last 30 years there's an article there's a podcast something i've done so i encourage you to start there and you'll be able to get a lot of insights a little bit deeper into what to do if you loved that last video you should check out the next one for sure
