[Use Fasting To REVERSE YOUR AGE & Prevent Disease! (Fasting For Survival) | Mark Hyman - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0YMUOP3Xuw)

> [!NOTE]- Summary
> - Fasting taps into the body's powerful innate healing system, surpassing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical drugs and offering the potential to reverse numerous diseases. By understanding how to activate this system, we can unlock its benefits.
>- Various fasting approaches, such as calorie restriction, ketogenic diets, and timing of meals, enable access to the body's healing capabilities. These methods share a common principle rooted in our biological adaptation to scarcity and starvation as hunter-gatherers.
>- The abundance of food in modern society, particularly in America where calorie intake has increased significantly, has led to obesity and health issues. We lack the genetic ability to regulate excess, unlike our abundance-regulating genes for times of scarcity.
>- Activating the ancient healing system through fasting triggers profound changes in hormones, cells, and genes. It optimizes gene expression to control inflammation, boosts antioxidant systems, reduces belly fat, builds muscle, enhances brain function and focus, increases bone density, and promotes beneficial hormone production and cell repair.
>- Fasting also stimulates autophagy and mitophagy, the processes through which the body breaks down and recycles old cellular components. Failure to engage in these processes can accelerate aging, while fasting supports cellular rejuvenation.
>- In addition to weight loss and muscle building, fasting has a positive impact on cardiovascular health. It may counteract immuno senescence and contribute to immunorejuvenation, improving the body's defense mechanisms.
>- Early misconceptions about fasting have been debunked. Previously, people were advised to eat small, frequent meals to keep metabolism high. However, research suggests that fasting can offer greater benefits, such as reducing the risk of Alzheimer's, balancing hormones, decreasing belly fat, increasing antioxidant systems, and boosting stem cell production.
>- Different fasting techniques exist within a spectrum. A 12-hour daily fast is recommended for everyone, where dinner is followed by breakfast the next day. This simple practice is often overlooked, as people tend to snack at night or delay breakfast.
>- Individual variations should be considered when choosing a fasting method. If a 16-hour fast feels uncomfortable, there might be underlying issues that need to be addressed. Consulting with experts or using fasting apps can provide guidance tailored to specific needs.
>- Concerns about getting enough calories during fasting, especially for individuals with active lifestyles, can be addressed by strategic meal planning. Ensuring an adequate intake of nutrients, healthy fats, and protein is essential to prevent unintended weight loss.
>- Fasting becomes increasingly important after the age of 50 due to the body's heightened need for cellular repair, waste elimination, muscle building, inflammation reduction, and overall health optimization.
>- Fasting can have implications for women's health, particularly with regards to hormone balance and fertility. While excessive fasting or starvation may disrupt fertility, the root causes of infertility in women often lie in insulin resistance and excessive sugar consumption.
>- Embracing the mindset of commitment and decision-making is crucial when undertaking fasting practices. Recognizing the potential benefits and aligning one's goals with the chosen fasting method can help navigate the process successfully.
>- Common mistakes in intermittent fasting include adopting extreme fasting durations without considering individual needs. Gradual progress and finding a balanced approach are key to sustainable fasting habits.
>- The impact of fasting extends beyond personal experiences, as scientific studies have supported the efficacy of fasting in improving biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease, mitochondrial function, insulin regulation, and metabolism.
>- Educating oneself about fasting and its diverse strategies is essential for making informed decisions. Many resources, such as books, documentaries, and fasting apps, are available to guide individuals on their fasting journey.

> (00:00) your body has its own innate healing system which is way way more powerful than any drug ever invented and can reverse almost every disease what are three to five top benefits of this whole ecosystem of fasting so we're gonna get into all the nitty-gritty of all the ways to access your body's healing system through focusing on when you eat calorie restriction ketogenic diets we're gonna go all into that but at a high level your body has its own innate healing system which is way way more powerful than any drug ever invented and can
(00:44) reverse almost every disease if we know how to activate it and so all these approaches that are being heavily researched and are incredibly powerful do very similar things and in a sense it has to do with this basic framework our biology is adapted to scarcity to starvation when we were hunter-gatherers we didn't know if we're going to kill a buffalo or find a root or a berry so we had to be really good at managing lack of food and when we do that it activates all these conservation healing repair systems so
(01:21) the body can actually survive without food now the problem today is we are in a state of abundance in america we have 500 calories more a day than we did 40 years ago and we're eating them which is why we're so obese in america so there's no problem with scarcity it's abundance and we don't have the genes to regulate abundance we have over 200 genes that regulate starvation and to help us adapt so what happens when you activate this ancient healing system well first you radically change your hormones your cells and your genes
(01:55) you change your gene expression and optimize expression that controls inflammation that increases your antioxidant systems that gets rid of belly fat that builds muscle that increases your brain and focus and cognitive function because you know when you're starving you got to go look for food you want to be alert it helps build your bone density it increases your your beneficial hormones helps growth hormone and it also helps repair your cells it also activates something really extraordinary which is something called autophagy and mitophagy
(02:28) what does that mean it means your body has a system of cleaning up and recycling old parts and when you don't do that you end up with a lot of old parts and so the goal of autophagy is to literally break down all the components of your cells and then clean them up and then rebuild them into new parts which is awesome but if you don't do that and a lot of the ways we live today in the 21st century do not let us do that we end up aging rapidly so not only does it help you lose weight and build muscle not only does it help
(02:59) balance your hormones increase your in antioxidant systems increase your stem cell production increase your brain chemistry focus but it also can actually reverse aging and there's a lot of data on how it actually can help in literally reversing the aging process it also is protective against cardiovascular disease it may be effective in cancer treatment and we know that applying these strategies during cancer reduces the side effects reduces the the complications and increases the efficacy and the benefits of traditional cancer
(03:28) chemotherapy so we're just scratching the surface and there's so many powerful processes that are activated by these strategies and we're going to get into those but that's the high level so if there's one single thing you can do to activate almost every single healing system in your body it's changed when you eat now you had a great newsletter recently and you were talking about this concept called zombie cells which directly ties in to what you just gave in the overview about autophagy i find it as a
(03:56) fascinating example can you just talk about what these zombie cells are and how they end up floating around our body so it's complicated but zombie cells are what they sound like they're they kind of don't die and they're they're kind of cells that increase senescence or aging uh that are part of our immune system so the aging process is one of inflammation or inflammation we call it and what happens is because of all life stresses and toxins and poor diet and all the things we're exposed to
(04:24) our bone marrow stem cells that make our white blood cells that are part of our immune system get damaged and those stem cells then produce damaged progeny right which are damaged cells so we produce a million t cells a minute in our bone marrow and they can get into our circulation but if they're funky which they are they call it chip cells then they create downstream effects of more inflammation more heart disease more autoimmunity and so forth and so zombie cells are part of this whole cocktail of dysfunction and what's
(04:57) exciting is by doing some of these practices and by including certain foods in your diet for example like himalayan tartary buckwheat which is a ancient an ancient plant it's not a grain actually it's a flower can help to increase the killing of the zombie cells and improve this whole immuno senescence and create something instead called immunorejuvenation and fasting is a part of that whole process as well too absolutely now let's take a step back and talk about some of the recommendations i remember reading articles in the early
(05:27) 2000s that it's dangerous to fast and people shouldn't fast and there was all these concerns and people were being told instead to eat every couple hours that was actually the best way to keep your metabolism high and burn more energy why did people think that back then how is that wrong and what changed it well i think we had a view that in order to balance your blood sugar you had to eat every three to four hours and i often advise patients about that these are people who are overweight who had swings and we we we did advise people
(05:58) not to eat before bed like three or four hours because it makes you gain weight i call it the sumo wrestler diet which is how they gain weight they they eat and they go to sleep uh and they drink a bunch of alcohol too and then your alcohol they have something called chunko nabe which is this huge like kind of japanese stew soup which is yummy but also it fills you right up and and even do that but but i think we kind of got in this idea that you have to eat all the time to keep your metabolism running and going and keep it
(06:23) burning and it's just turned out not to be true in fact it turned out the opposite is true that if we learn how to eat and focus on what we eat we don't have to worry about gaining weight or overeating because it will balance our blood sugar and insulin levels and we'll keep our metabolism even so if you eat the right foods you don't have to worry about eating that often because you won't be hungry you'll eat and you'll be hungry you know hours and hours later you don't have to
(06:50) eat every three to four hours the second thing we figured out is that that the body needs rest from food which is why we have something called breakfast or breaking the fast except most people eat up until they go to bed we have a snacking culture and then they eat as soon as they wake up and they don't get that rest period of at least 12 hours or 14 or 16 hours which really ends up being extremely beneficial for helping to not only repair and clean up waste and and and do the repair process that happen at night
(07:20) but to actually activate all the healing systems your body we talked about to reverse diabetes reverse heart disease improve your cognitive function may be improving your risk of alzheimer's or reducing your risk of alzheimer's it helps build muscle it reduces belly fat it reduces inflammation it increases your antioxidant systems it increases stem cell production so this is what we now know about these things and so we kind of got it wrong before so i think this is a perfect time to go through the spectrum of different things that fall
(07:47) under the umbrella of fasting can you walk us through a few talk to us about what they are and how they're done so there are many roads to rome there are many ways to access these healing systems in your body and they're each slightly different but they all do very similar things so we have what we call intermittent fasting i think most people when they say that mean time restricted eating meaning they eat within an 8 or 10 or 12 hour window meaning you don't eat for 12 14 or 16 hours a day that's what we call
(08:17) time restricted eating and that's been extensively studied and is great for weight loss for improving metabolism for helping with a whole host of chronic illnesses the second is true intermittent fasting which may be a 24 hour or 36 hour fast once a week or it could be a three-day fast once a month there's a lot of ways to do it then there's what we call fasting mimicking diets which are calorie restricted so you'd eat like say 800 calories a day for five days dr walter longo who wrote the longevity diet he's been
(08:46) on the podcast he's done a lot of research on that and has millions of dollars in nih funding to look at how it affects cancer heart disease diabetes aging and so many other things and because your body thinks it's starving it's you're not eating enough calories but your body's still getting some energy so you can function better but it's really a very powerful system and then there's the ketogenic diet which is sounds like you know you're still eating but and you can do keto with
(09:11) time-restricted eating or intermittent fasting too but keto itself is what happens to the body when we stop eating when you have no food your body starts to burn your body's stores of fat now what's fascinating is we have about 2500 calories of carbohydrate stored in our tissues as glycogen in our muscle so when you do the carb loading for a workout that's what they're trying to try to fill up your glycogen stores the problem is if you're if you're doing a long marathon run i mean i went for a 50 mile
(09:41) bike ride and i saw you know my calorie burn and i was like 2 300 calories towards the end of it and i'd sort of run out of gas from my glycogen but the body has about 30 to 40 000 maybe more depending on your weight it can have a lot more calories of fat so wouldn't it be better if you could burn the fat so your body is like a hybrid car right electric and gas the gas is carbohydrates and it burns dirty the keto which is fat burns clean so your cells can burn fatter carbs and when you burn fat again it's it's often that we had to do
(10:21) that because we're in a state of starvation it activates all the same healing mechanisms so ketogenic diets can have been shown to reverse cancer have been shown to be helpful in alzheimer's reverse type 2 diabetes the work of virta health and our colleagues and friends there sarah hallberg and sammy have shown that we can reverse type 2 diabetes even in advanced cases using a ketogenic diet because it activates all these healing repair mechanisms there's no drug on the planet that can reverse diabetes we
(10:46) manage diabetes you know we do we do chronic disease management by giving them drugs and insulin and we keep their blood sugar ideal and manage all their risk factors which is nonsense because when you understand how the body works you can work with it rather than against it and activate these healing systems so ketogenic diets do the same thing and then lastly there's there's true true calorie restriction for long-term diets and this is the only thing in animal studies has really shown to extend life by a third so in the human
(11:15) terms that means if you ate a third less calories you'd live a third longer instead of you live instead of living to 80 you'd live to 120. now i know people who are on this calorie restriction for life there's a whole society and i met some of them i'm like what do so what do you eat i'm like well i have five pounds of celery for breakfast and i have three pounds of tomatoes for lunch and i'm like i'm like that doesn't sound like fun i'm gonna skip that and so what what's
(11:41) been happening is that scientists have been exploring how to activate the same mechanisms that control aging without having to starve yourself your whole life because that doesn't seem like fun so there's little hacks and tricks that you can use like time restricted eating intermittent fasting fasting mimicking diets ketogenic diets all can be ways to access that same healing system in the body so the question that a lot of people have is how do they decide where to get started and when to explore these different
(12:10) options on the spectrum of fasting it depends on you okay everybody should do a 12-hour fast a day there's nobody who shouldn't do that and walk us through that just like it's super easy dinner at six you're gonna eat breakfast at six you eat dinner at age you can eat breakfast today right it's pretty simple it's simple but actually a lot of people don't do it no they don't do that they they late and they snack at night they have ice cream whatever snacks before they go to bed bad idea give yourself at
(12:35) least 12 hours and that's good for everybody when you start to move to 14 i mean think about if you're if you eat dinner at six you could eat breakfast at eight that's a 14 hour fast or if you want to do 16 you can eat dinner at 6 and have something at 10. so it's doable for a lot of people and i do it very often i don't have you don't have to do it every day i do it many days a week some people who are overly thin cert certain people with with disorders like cancer you have to be careful because there's
(13:05) weight loss issues that can happen it it can be stressful for the body for some people so it's not for everybody if you have adrenal issues if you're very frequent from some very tall thin women may not be effective for might cause cause symptoms so it's not everybody should do like a long 16 hour fast uh in terms of in terms of the um true intermittent fasting that can be a very therapeutic thing so you can do a you know a day a two day three day five day seven day ten day some people do three week just water fast that can
(13:36) be very therapeutic if you have some type of serious chronic illness and it can reset the system then there's the ketogenic diets which are really effective for certain conditions like type 2 diabetes alzheimer's autism parkinson's those can be very effective it's a little harder to do i don't know if people should be on it all the time so there's a lot of nuances to prescribe it as a medical therapy but but it also can be very effective so i would sort of for people start i would say start with
(14:03) the 12-hour fast if you want to move to 14 16 is not that hard for most people so try it on see how you feel see what happens often people have more energy more focus they lose weight they increase body muscle decrease belly fat and have lots more energy so there's there's there's there's no um there's no magic to it it's just looking at who you are what your issues are how do you match the right approach to you and then try them and see how you feel because if you for example if you do a
(14:29) 16 hour fast and you feel like crap maybe it's not right for you you know but there could be some underlining reasons which is why it's important to get educated on it yes you know your blood sugar might be out of control and there's a few of your friends and uh colleagues uh peter tia has a free fasting app that's out there dr jason fung has one as well they've both been on your podcast before jason fung has been on my podcast before we'll link to those show notes that are out there and
(14:56) uh you know this is the start of getting people excited about wanting to go down the path of education to learn what it is now in your instance you mentioned that with time-restricted eating you'll often do that you'll often do that a few days a week when it comes to these other fasts that are there on the spectrum do you incorporate those in your own life yeah i mean i've tried everything i've tried calorie restriction diets i've tried you know 24 36 hour fast i once did a sort of four day juice fast uh which is just
(15:24) green juices i also have tried keto um if i do keto too much i just drop too much weight i just like i it's it's a problem for me i didn't say that it gets shot down but i i do need some carbohydrate and and it really depends on your metabolism so i don't have any diabetes i'm very lean i don't have any insulin issues and so for me you know you know it may help me with certain other issues but i often will will really customize the way i prescribe diets based on what's going on with that person so if someone's
(16:00) overweight if they're diabetic or on the spectrum of diabetes you know i will recommend a ketogenic diet if someone has alzheimer's or autism i recommend it but i don't think it's for everybody if during cancer therapy which is amazing it can be extremely effective in in magnifying the benefits of traditional radiation chemo and minimizing the side effects so there's a lot of therapeutic benefits around it in terms of cancer in terms of alzheimer's even in heart disease what was interesting with the the group
(16:26) that was run by sarah hallberg who was part of virta health is they looked at not only the weight loss it was a 60 reversal of type 2 diabetes 100 of the patients got off the main medication for diabetes called oral hypoglycemics 90 plus percent got off insulin or reduced their dose weight loss was 12 which which is staggering most weight loss studies we get 5 people are jumping up and down they also looked at i think 20 or plus different biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and almost every single one was improved
(16:58) so you think i'm eating like 70 fat i mean saturated fat how does that work right how does that work where all my heart disease risk factors get better because it contracts everything we knew about eating a high fat diet right well it's because if you have a certain metabolic type namely if you're diabetic or insulin resistant on that spectrum that's what will happen but i have other patients for example i had one patient i put on a ketogenic diet of coconut butter and butter and you know basically veggies and
(17:26) a little protein and she'd been struggling with her weight had been very inflamed her cholesterol was over 300 her triglycerides were like 3 400 very low hdl which is a good cholesterol and we just couldn't budge her and so i said why don't you try this and she tried it and she immediately lost 20 pounds and her cholesterol dropped over 100 points her triglycerides dropped like 200 300 points her hdl went up and she did amazing on the other hand i had a patient who was a mid-50s guy who was an athlete and a you know aggressive bike
(17:57) ride would go for 50 100 bike rides and uh he's like i want to try it and see if it helps my performance and he tried it and his cholesterol numbers just went off the chart so we had to stop so everybody's different and there's a lot of heterogeneity but you have to expect yourself and what i say to people is the smartest doctor in the room is your own body you've also had an experience that your cholesterol went in the wrong direction on a super high fat diet just another reason high saturated fat high saturated
(18:28) fat diet another reason that it's important to remember that everybody operates a little bit differently there are broad spectrum themes that are there uh do you want to talk about that a little bit because i think it's useful for some people to know i mean you know in terms we're sort of bearing off a little bit from the the sort of fasting thing and talking more about eating a high saturated fat diet now many many studies have shown that saturated fat seems to contribute to heart disease but when you look at the data carefully it's
(18:55) in the context of an american processed diet in the context of a high carbohydrate starch sugar diet when you eat saturated fats with starch and sugar flour and sugar it's deadly however if you eliminate starch and sugar or grammatically reduce it most people will tolerate saturated fats however there's a small group there called lean mass hyper responders meaning they're guys like me who are athletic who are muscular who i mean i'm not like you know i'm like a bodybuilder muscular but i'm
(19:26) mostly muscle and very little fat they tend to have this phenomena where they have the opposite response in terms of their cholesterol than you'd expect so their ldl goes up their particle number goes up their size goes down it's kind of a wacky thing so i think what we're learning is that there's a lot of genetic variability in the population and we have to actually match the diet to our genes and to our own personal biology so i always say don't let your ideology trample over your biology
(19:54) make sure you know oh ketogenic diet sounds good i'm going to do that saturated no it may not be for you you know it may not and that's okay and i think you have to really customize your diet to what works and then i can eat olive oil i can eat avocados i can eat nuts and seeds i can have a lot of fat in my diet i just don't have saturated fat let's talk about the impact on sleep what do we know about sleep and fasting specifically time restricted eating well it seems to be that that the time restricted eating helps to improve sleep
(20:25) quality in terms of the amount of sleep the depth of sleep and all the sleep cycles so it's one of those sort of interesting findings that it actually helps to which is important because when you sleep and you sleep well it's when your body is in the repair shop it's when growth hormone increases which repairs tissues it's when cortisol goes down it's when blood sugar goes down it's when all these systems kind of kick into gear to help the body reset and repair so the better and the deeper
(20:54) your sleep the more you'll heal and it seems to be part of this idea of of this adaptation to scarcity is that when we're in this fasted state our bodies just prepare better and heal better and sleep better because sleep is part of the healing process can you talk about some of the protection against neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer's and parkinson's disease when it comes to the spectrum of fasting well it's really interesting findings because we're learning that one of the biggest drivers of
(21:23) alzheimer's is sugar and in fact scientists have called alzheimer's type 3 diabetes it's diabetes in the brain and there's a subset a big subset of people with alzheimer's because they're not all the same some might be bearded metals or mold or lime or whatever but the large subset is insulin resistant and it's insulin resistance in the brain and that's really driven off of carbohydrates so when you have a high carbohydrate diet starch and sugar and even you know what they think of as
(21:56) good carbohydrates grains and beans it can increase insulin and it can actually damage your brain so it's really important to understand that that if you have alzheimer's this may be going on and there's ways to test for it and i've had many patients you know with insulin resistance diabetes and alzheimer's and this works amazing for them and when you put them on a ketogenic diet it really helps their brain function better why because when your body's running on ketones one you reduce inflammation which is the main cause of
(22:26) alzheimer's oxidative stress which is a big factor in alzheimer's you increase mitochondrial function which is your energy centers in the brain so your brain works better and you obviously cut out the starch and sugar which cuts out the insulin resistance in the brain and helps all these things work together so what happens is when you put people on a high fat diet and by the way the brain is made up of mostly fat it's 60 fat mostly dha which is for fish oil so when you actually and it's got a lot
(22:54) of saturated fat in there and a lot of things in the brain so it's not that fat is bad you need fat for your brain and when you get in a keto diet when we were in this state before it was a state designed to increase our brain function why because if you're starving and you can't find anything to eat you better be focused alert on top of it so you can hunt and gather and find something to eat otherwise you die so there's a evolutionary reason for us to have better mental focus and concentration and memory and attention
(23:27) when we're in a ketogenic state or in a fasted state so i think i think that's the mechanism of action of how it works now i want to talk about fasting for women and their unique biology how is fasting and the spectrum of fasting different for women especially women in their child-bearing years well this is why drew i really emphasize the importance of personalization because this is might may be good for some people it also may not be good for others so if you're a woman who's in the child-bearing years if your woman is
(23:59) breastfeeding who's pregnant who's very thin who has adrenal issues and a lot of people do from chronic stress in your lives having long periods without eating is not usually good for you and you often feel badly and it doesn't provide the benefits that you would normally think something like that would provide that's not to say that the 12-hour rule will go that that is something that everybody should do the 12-hour time-restricted eating that generally is regarded as safe for most people don't eat after dinner any breakfast
(24:31) okay it's not a big it's not a big stress but for a lot of women who are sort of thinking about getting pregnant or breastfeeding or in this childbearing years you have to be very cautious about what you're doing your body and whether you're actually doing the right things you need to preserve fertility because when you're starving which is kind of what you're doing when you're in these states you're you're starving the body doesn't want to have babies right it's dangerous like dangerous to have a
(24:57) baby when there's no food around so the body naturally will shift the hormonal function to stop menstruation to stop ovulation to lower testosterone to do all these things for both men and women which is okay from an evolutionary point of view but long term is probably not a good thing and sometimes women will even lose their periods yeah if they are extreme fasting or on an extreme yeah all right mark now is the part of the master class where we go to our community questions from instagram the podcast youtube and email that we've
(25:30) selected here to go through so here's the first question that we have from an individual asking does fasting affect high blood pressure yes when you when you do any of these strategies that we talked about again they all activate healing systems so what causes high blood pressure it's actually an inflammatory disease it's a disease of oxidative stress it's driven primarily by two main pathways we call it essential hypertension which means essentially we have no clue what causes it but we actually do
(26:09) and the two major drivers there's others right low magnesium heavy metals and so forth the hormonal dysfunction there are two major major drivers one is insulin resistance or the spectrum of poor metabolic health from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes and that is extremely responsive to any of these strategies and two sleep apnea which can drive all kinds of problems in the body including insulin resistance and lead to high blood pressure so you kind of got to look at those two things and for intermittent fasting time restricted
(26:44) eating keto diets fasting making diets they will all help blood pressure all right fantastic next question how can you get enough calories if you lead an active lifestyle and still want to get the benefits of fasting it's a good point i mean i i often will struggle because i will start to drop weight if i'm not careful because it's great for the 88 percent of people in america are metabolically unhealthy and who are overweight or skinny fat so basically 9 out of 10 people awesome for weirdos like me
(27:17) it can be tricky so you have to make sure you in the time that you're eating in the 8 or 10 or 12 hours that you're eating that you're getting enough food and getting the right food so you often have to amp up some of the food you're eating and it's okay to do that as a follow-up question of that we have another individual asking i fast all day easily but once i have dinner the craving to eat more is horrendous why is that and is there anything that i can do yes yes so here's the problem
(27:45) you know sugar and starch will jack up your insulin insulin makes you hungry and crave more carbs and food when you load all your calories into too narrow window let's say i just eat one meal a day and you have to get 2 000 or 2500 calories in one meal it doesn't matter if it's the best food on the planet any large meal will trigger an insulin spike so you have to be i mean unless it's just pure fat like unless you just drink olive oil then it won't do that but i don't think most people are doing that
(28:18) so if you're having protein that gets turned to sugar it spikes insulin you basically will start to jack up insulin and that insulin is the hormone that makes you crave more food it makes you hungry and want to eat more even if you just ate a huge meal so you want to make sure you're not packing all your calories in one meal that's a problem and it's not just how much you eat it's also what you're eating during that window that you are eating can you just make that distinction sure i mean yeah
(28:44) okay so so here's some interesting data in time-restricted eating it works even if you don't change your diet like what you're eating right if you're feeling crap and you do that it helps fix your metabolism but it works way better if you eat the pagan diet meaning a whole foods plant rich phytochemical rich high fiber high quality fat good protein diet which is what i recommend so actually optimizing your diet will help optimize the all these technologies you know as you're doing them next question we have should the fasting
(29:18) period get longer as you age over 50 should you fast longer when you age over 50. why should you fast at all after 50. well for sure you should and you can and it's helpful because what happens as we age is we need more cleanup we need more repair we build more waste we have more old cells we have we need more autophagy more mitophagy we need to build more muscle we need to lose more body fat we need to reduce more inflammation because as we age all these things start to go wrong that are really the result of not
(29:51) having the right strategy for optimizing our health so the normal course of life in america is the typical american diet is lack of exercise chronic stress and unmitigated or unaddressed those things will all accelerate aging so any of these strategies will help to reverse that and actually reverse your biological age so we talked about this before big picture but i think it's worth hitting on again so the question from the listener is is it appropriate to continue intermittent fasting during pregnancy yes no it's not
(30:25) i mean i i would not recommend pregnant women do what you're saying is intermittent fasting which is go for 24 hours or 36 hours without eating anybody can go 12 hours and i think we should and it's probably good for the baby to do that longer periods 14 16 you have to see how you feel but you know i think you know one of the challenges i see with with pregnancy is that that doctors give women a free license to eat whatever they want you know just make sure you gain weight make sure your baby's growing eat ice cream and all
(30:54) this crap bad idea you have to still regulate your diet even more when you're pregnant because you're feeding the baby all the basic ingredients to grow and develop so if you're not having a high quality diet your baby is not being made of high quality ingredients so you want to make sure that you optimize the quality of your diet while you're pregnant and not just the ice cream and crap and that you actually are getting enough calories which you need more calories right because you're feeding tube
(31:24) but it doesn't mean you have to crap and and you can do a 12-hour overnight fast which is fine that's called breakfast but in general it's really important to focus mostly on this the quality component of it and if you're doing that and you have certain cravings or other things like that as long as you're eating mostly quality food you really don't have to worry about timing and fasting there's plenty of time to do that later on no no another question about women's health is intermittent
(31:47) fasting good for balancing hormones it's tricky because if you do too much fasting or too much starvation you're activating systems in your body that are designed to prevent prevent fertility so you can go overboard but most infertility in women is caused by too much sugar and starch insulin resistance insulin resistance pcos being one of the big culprits polycystic ovarian syndrome but it's not an ovarian problem it's a nutritional problem and there's a book actually by a bunch of harvard scientists called the
(32:19) fertility diet which is about using an approach that lowers blood sugar to actually help fertility so if you are one of those women who's insulin resistant who's overweight who's got belly fat somewhere on the spectrum of p diabetes and by the way ninety percent of people have pre-diabetes have no clue like i said nine at most nine out of ten americans have pre-diabetes that's crazy right we said it was one out of two had pre-diabetes diabetes but this new data from government surveys and lab testing
(32:48) has found that 88 of americans have either high blood pressure high blood sugar or abnormal cholesterol all of those are symptoms of insulin resistance right that's what's causing that for the most part so when you when you look at that you go well if you're in that state and your hormones are screwed up and women's hormones do get screwed up they get lack of ovulation often they'll get high levels of estrogen because all the fat tissue makes estrogen they'll get increases in testosterone
(33:18) because of some of the ways the shunting of estrogen goes to testosterone there's a whole chicken wire pathways that connects all the hormones so progesterone estrogen testosterone very very similar hormones they're just slightly tweaked you'll get more testosterone which means you can get hair loss on your head you can grow facial hair you get acne uh you get irregular periods so intermittent fasting temperature needing all these techniques all will help fix that because it fixes in some resistance
(33:42) for men you know it's interesting because men also have the same phenomena happen but a little different thing happens when they gain belly fat and they're having too much starch and sugar it increases insulin which then increases fat cells which then produce estrogen and lowers testosterone so a lot of guys who have this will have low testosterone low sex drive low low low sex function they'll have high levels of estrogen they'll get uh loss of hair on their bodies they'll grow man boobs they'll kind of get
(34:17) smooth skin so they look more like women you've seen these guys who have the beer bellies and this is because they're eating so much toxic sugar so it can screw up men's hormones too and on all these techniques will also fix that do you have any mindset tips to help you through the process of fasting whether it's time restricted eating or intermittent fasting i mean you just kind of have to decide to do it it's like it's not actually that hard i think you know anybody can do 12 hours and then you can
(34:49) try you know like if i said can you walk for one minute unless you're really you know old or decrepit or in a wheelchair most people can walk for a minute right then you walk for two minutes then you walk for three minutes and then you walk for four minutes and then you walk for an hour right so it's basically starting to actually push the limits of what your body is comfortable with and starting to notice the effects and the benefits and paying attention like i said your body is the best doctor in the room it will
(35:15) tell you exactly what works and what doesn't pay attention can you have coffee or tea when you're doing time restricted eating or intermittent fasting that's a great question i have understood that the answer is yes if it's got nothing in it if there's no milk or sugar or cream or anything else that it won't break ketosis or it won't cause that other people have said it might but i think my gut feeling is that it probably won't have a huge impact because it's not a lot of calories and
(35:48) essentially it just it's just caffeine and water basically are there any other nutrients that you might tell people to include and the answer could be no when they're in their fasting window is there any other things that we're looking for or is it more just letting the body do its thing well i mean i think most people like us have always said should be in a multivitamin fissure and vitamin d that usually covers most of the bases to keep all your metabolic pathways going because you are needing more nutrients
(36:16) as you're fasting to actually clean up the waste to regulate pathways and all the enzymes all the functions in your body require nutrients so i think it's important people be on something uh with that said i don't think there's a reason to stop i don't think there's a reason to take extra stuff unless you have a specific goal like if you're trying to fix your liver or if you're trying to fix your kidneys or you're working on something specific but i think for most people it's okay to
(36:39) just take a good multificial and vitamin d and then they probably not only it's okay it's probably important to do that while you're doing some type of time restricted or intermittent fasting what are the biggest mistakes people make when it comes to intermittent fasting the biggest one is when we just talked about people say well you know 12 hours is good 14 hours better if 14 hours is good six hours better if six hours good 20 hours is better if that's good 22 hours is better and it's not um it's not if you're doing
(37:05) time restricted eating on a daily basis you want to spread your calories out over that window of eight hours because you don't want to load up your system with too many calories in one meal that is what will cause more problems so i really don't encourage that with that said you know people can do other forms of of fasting like intermittent fasting where they really are having a full fast for 24 36 hours that's okay but you don't want to constantly load all of your calories into too short a window that's one of
(37:35) the biggest risks i see when it comes to intermittent fasting in the west meaning north america a lot of you know the uk and other places that follow very similar lifestyles it's often that people will skip breakfast as a way to get into their intermittent fasting i saw an episode that you did with walter longo where he said in most of the world when they practice fasting especially in the east they actually do have breakfast and they'll skip other meals in the day because breakfast helps power their brain and give them
(38:06) energy for the day do you have any thoughts on that yeah i mean i think it depends on you like sometimes you'll feel like i feel better if i just don't eat in the morning and i have more clarity and focus but it also depends on what you eat when i have my power protein you know adaptogenic microbiome mitochondrial immune boosting shake in the morning i feel awesome right if i do after my workout but i usually usually give at least 14 hours from dinner so i'll maybe do it at nine o'clock or something like that after a workout
(38:33) other people if they have the wrong breakfast it can really cause huge problems if you're eating starch and sugar for breakfast basically dessert for breakfast which is breakfast in america folks right cereal which is 75 sugar and i like to say i'm a serial killer i don't think we should be eating cereals one of the biggest myths and propaganda stories of our time i i think we should not be eating the typical american breakfast which is pancakes french toast muffins bagels uh you know latte frappuccino mocha
(39:03) bacon those you know probably have 600 calories of sugar in them you know those are not what we should be having for breakfast we need fat and protein for breakfast so if you start your day with fat and protein for breakfast and phytonutrients you're going to do way better and your brain will be fine but it's also okay if you want to skip dinner and have breakfast and eat lunch and not eat late in the day that's okay too i think that's a fine way to do this there's no there's no trick you can try
(39:27) both ways and see how you feel do you wanna know my secrets for living a long and happy and healthy life well all i have to do is check out my weekly newsletter mark's picks where i share my favorite tips for health longevity well-being and lots more check it out and the link below mark what else do you want to talk about when it comes to fasting there's some interesting components that we didn't get a chance to touch on so i'm going to get a little geeky here guys because this is the stuff that interests me and
(39:52) hopefully it'll interest you which is that there are master control switches for aging and health and there are often genes that regulate our metabolism and our mitochondria so when i say metabolism what does that mean it means how well does your body burn food in other words when you take oxygen and calories that you eat in food and you burn them they burn a little part of your cell called the mitochondria and there's tens to tens of thousands of these in the cells you have and this system has to work well in
(40:31) order for you to be healthy many of the things we do cause our mitochondria to age fast and cause them to slow our metabolism down and to have poor function and that leads to loss of energy that leads to all the disease i mean everything we see is a mitochondrial disease heart disease mitochondrial diabetes mitochondrial alzheimer's mitochondrial parkinson's mitochondria i mean all these things are mitochondrial so what is one of the switches that we can play with that we can use the science of of when we eat
(41:03) and what we eat to actually activate these pathways that are embedded in us again that are way way smarter than any pharmaceutical company than any human being we've been designed to have these systems that literally will reverse aging so as we begin to study these these strategies including calorie-restricted eating they do a number of things there's a number of genes in the mitochondria that regulate our insulin and blood sugar and metabolism uh daph2 foxo mtor and and and these are really important genes and sirtuins that regulate all
(41:40) these downstream effects you want to change the expression of those genes so you can optimize the function of your mitochondria which is the key to longevity it's the key to healthy life it's the key to having energy so uh you don't really have to know about all this sciencey geeky stuff but these particular pathways around uh sirtuins and foxo and daf2 and mtor they're all regulated by our diet and by the quality of our diet and by the the timing of eating and by all these techniques we just talked about and i remember i
(42:11) remember um talking to one of the scientists i was in a longevity conference it was in upstate new york i was at menla which is a robert thurman's retreat center that's a tibetan retreat center and he had the dalai lama there all these tibetan doctors and every nobel prize winner and aging and longevity and hell it was quite a collection of people and the talks were fascinating and this one guy from mit leonard guarte is the scientist that uncovered this pathway around sirtuins now we've all heard oh red wine is good for you and
(42:44) your spiritual is great and it can extend your life well he's the guy who kind of figured a lot of that out with david sinclair and i said to him what's the deal with these fortunes like what is the thing that's causing them to be dysfunctional to cause a decrease in mortality increase in disease and how do we how do we fix this he looks at me and he goes well it's pretty simple it's sugar that messes it all up so it's literally sugar and starch that are causing all these genes to be dysregulated
(43:12) so what's the antidote to sugar and starch in our diet it's intermittent fasting time restricted eating keto diet fascinating diet all these strategies are designed to reverse the harm that sugar has done to our cells so you don't actually have to understand all this kind of fancy terms but you just need to know that your body has these master switches that regulate aging longevity and health and the key to living long and healthy is learning how to activate those switches so that's the beauty of all these
(43:42) techniques you just do what do what they say and you'll it'll do it automatically that's beautiful and sugar can be so addictive and you've built an entire program around hunting helping people it's called a 10-day sugar you hold you built your whole life around sugar in a great documentary called fed-up with a 10-day detox diet there's a book it's out there people can get it they can follow that plan yes i mean i you know i think i think i wrote this book it was probably 2014 so i wrote it in 2012.
(44:11) you know i always i always see things in my practice with patience and i and then i'm like um this is coming like something about this is coming and i can understand that with sugar the science around addiction not just oh i'm wanted or like i need it or i like it but actually biological addiction where you have clear pathways that are activated in the brain that are the same that are activated with heroin or cocaine or there's clear withdrawal symptoms from not eating it it really meets the criteria of of sugar addiction i'm just
(44:46) going to tell you one quick story about it and why i wrote the book and how people can learn how to get unhooked right because it's really important like you're listening to this you're like oh my god you know dr hyman you're right but i love sugar i don't know i try to stop i can't i just crave it it's like a overwhelming i just don't know what to do like i got you okay i've got you it's not that hard so what what what happens is when you when you are looking at at the science about this
(45:12) it's fascinating i mean they they've taken a mice for example and these are kind of cruel and mean but you know it's scientists do this they they literally would would give them cocaine and they hooked them up to an iv of cocaine and if they hit this button they would get as much cocaine as they wanted or they could go eat some sugar they would work eight they would they would literally give up the cocaine and go get the sugar and they would work eight times harder to get the sugar than to get the cocaine
(45:44) that's frightening another study they put them in this special cage with an electric floor and whenever they ate sugar they would shock them now most time when you shock an animal it will avoid whatever the thing is that shocked them these mice would keep eating the sugar even while they're getting shocked now that's a pretty cruel study but it's it's pretty uh it's pretty impressive when you look at the results there was a human study where they didn't put them in a cage they didn't
(46:08) shock them or anything like that but they took overweight guys and they this was done by harvard scientists rigorous study published in major journal like i think journal american medical association it's not like a kind of a third rate study this is a powerfully well-done and well-designed study by david ludwig and they took overweight guys and they gave them on different days different milkshakes now the milkshakes were identical in calories in protein in fat in carbohydrate and fiber so macronutrients or identical the only
(46:42) difference was one of the milkshakes had a slowly absorbed sugar to not spike your blood sugar and the other one had a rapidly absorbed starch or sugar but they tasted the same you couldn't tell them apart so they took these guys and one day they gave the low search one and then the high sugar one and then they measured their blood they put them in mri scanners they looked at functional memories of their brain the group that had the low starch sugar were fine they didn't activate any pathways related to
(47:12) addiction their blood sugar and they stayed even their lipids were fine their cortisol was fine the group that had the high sugar one actually not only did they activate adrenaline which is a stress hormone cortisol was a stress hormone insulin went up blood sugar went up blood pressure went up cholesterol went up but when they did the brain imaging they found the area in the brain that's responsible for addiction biological addiction like heroin cocaine that kind of stuff called the nucleus accumbens it lit up like a christmas tree
(47:44) so you're like whoa they don't even know that they're eating something different it's like they oh i have so much pleasure it feels so good this milkshake tastes so good this one tastes terrible they tasted the same so it wasn't even a felt emotional response it was literally the biology of sugar which is staggering so and there are many many studies i wrote this book the 10-day detox diet because so many people are addicted to carbohydrates and sugar when i say sugar i mean it starts in sugar because white flour which is the
(48:12) main starch in this country is got a higher glycemic index than table sugar meaning you know a a sandwich will raise your blood sugar more than two tablespoons of table sugar right so that's not good and and so we have to think about them the same but that's why i wrote the 10-day detox site was to design a way of eating and a few simple lifestyle hacks that changes your hormones like that within a day or two and i remember teaching a workshop at grapala once years ago and this woman came in it was to do the 10-day detox
(48:42) diet and she was like dr hyman i really know i get enough sugar i just can't like i've been eating my whole life i try i try it never works i doubt this is going to work i'll try it i'll do it but i i don't think you're going to be able to help me and i'm like okay let's see what happens so you know we had the whole program developed we had bras we had shakes we had all the food designer exactly and it's all designed in a scientific way to balance all your brain chemistry to balance your hormones to
(49:07) balance insulin to fix everything and after day two she's like i don't know what happened dr hyman my cravings are gone i don't really want anymore like i'm done like i'm like wow and so when you when you understand how hard it is to quit but how if you use science not willpower you can literally hack food and sugar addiction and that's really what the 10-day detox site is about a powerful testimony and luckily there's a lot of new apps and tools and gadgets that are coming on the market there's
(49:38) one that you're involved in it's called levels yes it's a continuous glucose monitor just chat a little bit about that it's not for everybody but it could work really great for a lot of folks listen everybody's different you know in terms of your response to foods you can't say you're like your friend or your sibling or your parent you don't know right we just don't know how our own biology responds and i'll just kind of start with a little kind of anecdote about a research study
(50:03) that was in israel a number of years ago and in this study they looked at how different people responded to the same foods think okay if i eat a slice of bread it should raise my blood sugar the same as yours or as yours or whoever is listening but it doesn't work like that so what they found was this was very this was a very kind of nuanced study but they did was they found that looking at the microbiome which is the mass of bacteria in your gut they were able to predict different responses based on the microbiome so not
(50:37) everybody's blood sugar went up the same with the same food it depended on what's going on in their gut that's just sort of one example right so not everybody has the same response to any particular food which is why it's so important to know your body and i'm so excited about these new technologies called continuous glucose monitors or cgms and this company levels has really nailed it and they they had i'm an advisor an investor just to be transparent but they really nailed it and they figured out how to you know
(51:07) this little tiny device that goes on your skin a little patch and it measures your blood sugar all the time and you know you can tell i can i remember the first time i used it i put it on i was visiting a friend of mine in martha's vineyard and there was this sort of regenerative organic like farm and they they cooked all these gourmet foods and and they brought this like feast of you know lamb and veggies and this and that and it was all healthy it was all really yummy food and my my friend who was actually
(51:38) also my age but he's super fit he's muscular thin healthy like seriously healthy and we both put it on we both had this meal and then we were in bed like 10 o'clock at night checking our blood sugar and we're like texting each other what's going on our blood sugar is like 160.
(51:56) how does this happen like both of us freaking out i'm like i think it's just because we ate too much food so even if you eat too much food even as healthy we'll do that so you don't really know and i you know i remember i was using it when i was in hawaii and someone brought over this vegan macadamia nut ice cream which was so freaking good and i ate a little too much and i was like whoa it just spiked my blood sugar whereas you know maybe another food wouldn't do that so it's really good to know what your body is doing which is why i recommend people to
(52:25) in order to understand what's happening to measure blood sugar but i've talked to casey who's the founder of the company i said look blood sugar is great we need to know it but more important is insulin because a lot of people have blood sugar very well controlled until the last minute because having high blood sugar is kind of dangerous so the body has really good mechanisms for keeping it in control until it doesn't which is then called diabetes right so the mechanisms can go on for 20 30 years
(52:54) where your blood sugar stays normal but your blood insulin keeps going up and up and up and up and the insulin itself will cause havoc even if you don't have diabetes it causes heart attacks strokes cancer it can cause belly fat gain muscle loss inflammation on and on and on so fatty liver so just because your blood sugar is okay doesn't mean you're okay but it's a first step and i think we're going to be measuring insulin soon when they figure out the technology around that but i can't wait for that to happen
(53:21) it's all coming it's all coming in the future and in the meantime there's plenty that you can do even with a without gadgets and devices to head in the right direction mark let's do a little bit of a recap on this conversation on fasting and tell us like if people are just going to get started after listening to this conversation what is literally step one and take us through a little bit of a recap of some of the things that we covered i mean like the easiest thing to do for everybody is just a 12-hour fast
(53:46) which we talked about if you want to extend it to 1416 play with that that's the easiest approach to activating these systems fasting for 24 36 hours once a week another option a little more tricky harder to do not going to kill you but you know we do it on yom kippur or people doing a ramadan or something it's like it's it's in cultures but it's it's a little harder keto is even harder and calorie restriction you can't do that long you can do it for five days so people can do that so there's all these
(54:13) different choices people have and even the five day fasting mimicking diet can be really effective you can do it on your own which is 800 calories a day or you can use various products from walther longo it all goes to his research which is quite good called prolon that's an option but for most people just doing the 12 to 14 16 hour fast is great so why should you bother well we all need to go to the repair shop right we can't just lit i mean you don't forget about your car and not take it in to the shop for repairs not taking in
(54:46) for an oil change for tune-up you know we go in and have like a thousand point checkup we reset everything and it runs beautifully we can do that for our bodies and that's what these techniques do so just to recap they they activate every system in your body that's designed to protect you heal you and make you live longer it reduces inflammation which is the biggest cause of aging it increases your antioxidant systems which are important it causes you to lose belly fat it increases muscle increases bone density increases
(55:12) your brain function it reduces insulin blood sugar cholesterol helps with diabetes can help prevent or even reverse cancer in some cases so there's so many benefits to it and it activates these mechanisms called these longevity mechanisms around sir two ends and daph2 and foxo and mtor so there's a whole strategy around how to use these technologies to actually increase your well-being to lose weight to reverse chronic disease and to live longer if you loved that last video you're gonna love the next one check it out
(55:44) here we eat dairy now in a homogenized pasteurized form which is unlikely ever did before historically and pasteurization is good because it reduces the risk of infection and you know terrible things you can get from raw milk but the homogenation process actually
